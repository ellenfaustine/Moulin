    author: "By Ole Spötter",
    content:
      " With the Kingpins denim show in Amsterdam and the launch of several new denim collections, such as the return of the Moschino jeans line and the collaboration between G-Star Raw and model Rose Bertram, there was a strong focus on the popular material in October." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "While denim was heavily featured on SS23 catwalks, including in the collections of Givenchy, Diesel and Balenciaga, the industry also showed its love for the fabric on the streets. FashionUnited took a look at street style for fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and Copenhagen, where it became clear that the Y2K trend had definitely made its impact on denim." +

      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Shimmery denim" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The first glimpse of shimmer on denim’s horizon was seen in the return of the noughties’ completely shiny material. Jeans with a metallic look, whether in classic denim blue, black or with a full radiant silver, were back. The style can be combined in a Canadian tux (denim from top to bottom) or alone, as a top or bottom with other contrasting pieces. To further spotlight the look, add pieces in complementary Y2K colour palettes, using shades like pink and baby blue." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Camouflage" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "This colour palette could be seen on jeans with typically camouflage-esque prints. With some plain models with grey tones often present, the trend seemed more approachable than the classic military look of green and brown, as seen on the men in Milan and Florence." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The camouflage jeans were combined with tops that utilised the print’s staple colours and brought a certain casualness, with long coats and loose jumpers added over the top. On the other hand, the use of short jackets and crop tops paired with the typically wide-cut trousers allowed for an exciting play on the silhouette.",

    title: "The best eyelash growth serums for longer, thicker lashes",
    author: "By Tish Weinstock",
    content:
      "Want long and voluminous lashes without having to go down the extensions route? Or, equally laborious, having to fiddle around with falsies? It’s time to invest in an eyelash growth serum. From thickening to lengthening, the best eyelash growth serums are designed to nourish your lashes from root to tip." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Do eyelash growth serums work?" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "In a word: yes. After years of extensions, my eyelashes were in a pretty bad state: thin, sparse, lacklustre. But after using an eyelash serum everyday for a month (and believe me, I was a sceptic), they started growing back threefold." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“Our eyelashes go through a cycle of around three months,” says Nima Pourian, founder of cult brand UKLash. “During the growth stage, our cells divide quickly to create new hair growth; in the transition phase the hair stops growing and detaches itself from the body’s blood supply, and in the final resting stage the fully formed hairs stay rooted, whilst new hairs begin to grow underneath them.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Charged with a powerful blend of nutrients, eyelash serums work to reduce the fallout and encourage new growth during the growth phase, whilst strengthening and nourishing existing hairs during the resting phase. “Our serums can be used by anyone looking to achieve longer, fuller and healthier looking eyelashes,” says Pourian. “They can even be used by those who have gone through chemotherapy, to encourage regrowth afterwards. We have had some incredible stories from customers who have been able to grow their lashes back after losing them during chemo.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Are eyelash serums safe?" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Most serums are composed of natural ingredients such as lipids and peptides, which, in theory, shouldn’t cause a reaction. But, like most active beauty formulas, it is always advised to do a patch test before applying. “It is very rare that someone would have a reaction,” says Pourian. “But the eyes can be sensitive so it is always best to check first! It is also important to follow instructions correctly and not to overuse the serum.” If you’re concerned in any way you can always speak with a medical practitioner, particularly if you are pregnant, nursing or have any other medical conditions ahead of trying a new serum." +

      "<br />" +
      "The collection features printed sweatshirts, hoodies, polo shirts, trousers, and jackets in a price range between 49 pounds and 395 pounds. Each item merches Gilbert's experience of over 200 years in the sports industry and Rodd & Gunn’s attention to detail by incorporating elements of its origin like the historic iconography of rugby players on the Landowne Road sweat." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“The game of Rugby is a study in a hardworking, humble, relentless pursuit of excellence. Teamwork and not the individual is key. It’s a global sport that touches so many different cultures, and they come together under the same sport. These values really resonated with me when conceptualizing this project”, said John Prikryl, creative director of Rodd & Gunn. “I would love this collaboration to extend and become the pre-eminent global après-rugby lifestyle concept.”" +

      "Beanies are in again—these are the picks to add to your wardrobe now",
    author: "By Azrin Tan",
    content:
      "One only needs to look to the colder parts of the world for a necessary masterclass on how to accessorise smartly without piling on the bulk. Where knits—think legwarmers or headwear—make for delicious additions that fulfil its purpose of keeping one warm. And out of the multiple variations of outfit-making headwear, the beanie can be said to be a certified pick; a trusty option relied on by many." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Once categorised as a standard essential for the winter wardrobes, the head accessory has since seen a vibrant uptake, with eclectic variations of the style increasingly seen both on the runway and out on the streets, no matter the season. At Coperni’s show during the last fall/winter 2022 season, it was envisioned in a hooded, face-framing form—almost akin to the balaclava—that provided ample warmth to the neck area as well. During the recent menswear showing, Gucci delivered copious pairings of the style with tailored ensembles, extending its lifespan to the world of workwear as well." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Meanwhile, some of our favourite celebrity faces—from all over the globe—stamped their status as style makers, with the likes of Bella Hadid carrying the rather louche, bonnet-style beanie as she waltzed about town. Charles Jeffrey Loverboy’s chunky ears silhouette has also been adopted swiftly by the K-pop set in a kaleidoscope of hues—seen on the likes of Red Velvet’s Seulgi, Seventeen’s Dokyeom and Blackpink’s Lisa." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "To make the best outfits work, a great deal of thought needs to go into your choice of accessory. And with the playful myriad of beanie styles out there now, we’ll say that they’ll be guaranteed to deliver on both the style and functionality fronts, especially when you consider how it is no longer an accessory merely tied to the colder climes. So before you start carting out on any, make sure to peruse Vogue‘s full edit below." +

    author: "By Alli Sim",
    content:
      "Much like a diamond, clarity and radiance go hand-in-hand. The smoother the surface, the better its ability to reflect light. The same can be said for the complexion: the more refined it is, the brighter and clearer our skin appears. Sadly, glow-robbing forces—late nights, poor nutrition, alcohol, sun damage, fluctuating hormones, and more are constantly in play." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "A must for anyone who is looking to regain their lustre, this list of Singapore’s best skin-brightening facials offer the sensoriality of a spa escape with the results-driven nature of aesthetic treatments. Often loaded with radiance-boosting ingredients such as vitamin C, licorice or in The History of Whoo‘s case—heritage hanbang herbs that amp up blood circulation—they effectively clarify skin, stimulate blood circulation, and promote cellular turnover for a lit-from-within look. Signs of dullness, stress, and skin fatigue are treated in 90 minutes or less, and you’ll emerge fresher and with red-carpet-ready skin to boot." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Of course, while these brightening facials are a boon for overall luminosity, eradicating hyperpigmentation, acne scars and melasma entirely is going to take the help of the big guns. But if general radiance is what you’re after, these facials will help you emerge with positively glowing, glass skin. Read on to get switched on to Singapore’s best brightening facials." +

      "Hilton Maldives Amingiri is the oceanic piece of paradise made for slow living",
    author: "By Chandreyee Ray",
    content:
      "For a location so prolifically photographed, the islands of the Maldives remain uniquely difficult to capture in a picture. It is easy to pull together an arresting image of a Maldivian beach in your mind’s eye. Teal waves glitter in the bright sun, skirted by wisps of cloud-like sea foam, sweeping gently onto white sand so pure your feet sink pleasantly with every step. And yet, no matter how vivid your imagination, you can almost be certainly sure that it pales in comparison to the real thing." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "A 20-minute speedboat ride from Velana International Airport in the Maldivian capital of Male is the new, breathtakingly pristine Hilton Maldives Amingiri. The resort’s proximity to Male means guests can bypass seaplanes, which tend to suspend service after sunset, leaving travellers to camp out overnight in an airport hotel." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "I arrived at the resort in the dead of night, which allowed me to wake up the next morning in my overwater villa to one of the greatest surprises imaginable—a stunning, crystal-clear view of the Maldivian ocean through floor-to-ceiling windows." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "True to their name, the overwater villas hang over the ocean and have various vantage points (including strategically positioned glass screens built into the floors) that offer undisturbed views of the ocean. Luxuriantly spacious and elegantly appointed with modern furnishings, these enclaves come with a private pool and deck, alongside a ladder that leads down directly into—you guessed it—the ocean." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The beach pool villas are no less alluring, particularly if you are travelling with children. Each one extends into a sandy patch of private beach perfect for rolling around in, replete with a plush deck swing. No matter the configuration, each Hilton Maldives Amingiri villa comes fitted with an ocean-facing tub, positioned precisely for a languid soak with stunning vistas of the surrounding lagoon. It invites the sort of genuine serenity that strikes through your very core, manifesting from an appreciation for the splendour of nature." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "On the boardwalk that connects the row of overwater villas with the main island, I spot two clay-coloured bicycles leaning against a railing, shortly before my neighbours—a young family of three—step out of their dwelling and ride off on their bikes, tyres cutting tracks through fine sand." +

    title: "How to treat neck wrinkles, according to skin experts",
    author: "By Kiana Murden",
    content:
      "It may come as a surprise to some that neck wrinkles can appear before face wrinkles. “The neck tends to age faster than our face because it is thinner; therefore, natural loss of collagen and elastin in the skin can lead to sagging, loose skin (laxity), and wrinkle formation more readily,” explains Dr Caroline Robinson, who also cites constant neck motion, looking down at tech devices frequently, or inadequate protection from external stressors as potential causes. Though neck wrinkles are a natural part of the ageing process, skin experts say there are ways to treat and stave off their appearance." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“The best way to prevent neck wrinkles is a good daily skin care regimen, including sunscreen of at least 30 SPF, hydration, a healthy balanced diet, and avoidance of Instagram (just kidding), or at least elevating your smartphone so you are not constantly bending your neck,” advises Dr Savetsky, who notes that our reliance on technology and no dedicated neck beauty regimen means this area might see wrinkles faster than the rest of the body." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Generally speaking, you should extend your facial treatments to your neck. “The principles of treatment for the neck and décolletage are the same as they are for the face, in that the goals are to protect, prevent, repair, and restore,” says Dr Garshick. “This means at the very least incorporating a moisturiser and a sunscreen for your neck as well, and consideration of other ingredients like antioxidants, retinols, peptides, and growth factors.” However, Dr Park emphasises an important caveat: “The neck skin is particularly sensitive, so I would not use harsh acids like AHAs or even a strong retinoid on the neck without testing it out first.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Aside from your daily skin care routine, there are a handful of products and treatments committed to the needs of the skin along the neck. Because of its complex ageing process that encompasses texture changes, loose skin and uneven skin tone, Dr Robinson recommends her patients use multiple modalities to treat it. In-office treatments are a great starting point: microneedling to stimulate collagen, laser and chemical peels for evening tone, as well as Botox and fillers to address horizontal lines. Read on to discover the at-home treatments that can work wonders simultaneously." +

    author: "By Danielle James",
    content:
      "I'm in the trendy area of East London—Shoreditch, to be exact—arguably the perfect place to interview Zoë Kravitz, the connoisseur of cool. I enter a palatial suite in the Nobu Hotel. The room is clean and minimalistic, but still edgy, featuring a floating chair that looks more like a work of art than actual seating. To the left, my eyes fall on Kravitz. With her legs perfectly crossed and one hand laid gently on top of the other, as they both rest on her knee, she peers at me and smiles. It lightens up the room." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "She begins to fuss with her bangs. Her glam team immediately interjects. They do a little zhuzhing, but it fixes nothing—they were already perfect. I sit across from Kravitz and she proceeds to give me her full attention, as if there are not five other people in the room. I get slightly nervous by the onlookers, but I can tell she’s used to this. After all, she was literally born into this—arguably having two of the hottest people in Hollywood (Lisa Bonet and Lenny Kravitz) as her parents." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "We’re here to celebrate YSL Beauty’s heritage and newest fragrance, Black Opium Le Parfum. Kravitz has been the face of the brand since 2017. Through this partnership, YSL Beauty has conveyed its desire to reach a younger, edgier, more Kravitz-esque audience to the masses. The actress has grown with the company, beginning in her late 20s, now on the brink of her mid-30s, but YSL has grown too. “YSL has been so wonderful in terms of getting to know me and allowing me to me be,” Kravitz says. “It feels effortless because I don’t have to transform into something that I’m not to represent the brand.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "It seems as if YSL Beauty is undergoing a transformation of its own. Historically, the luxury, high-fashion brand wasn’t accessible to the fashionable youth, but through YSL Beauty, it’s reaching a whole new audience. Its suite of products currently speak directly to the Gen-Z and young millennial demographics, who want dewy skin and items that look good and are good for the complexion. “I think it’s going in a really beautiful direction,” Kravitz adds, referencing the Nu Lip & Cheek Balmy Tint with Hyaluronic Acid that I’m wearing, and how it’s not a product I expected from the brand. “They’re branching out—getting, younger and fresher. Even the colors are changing, and it’s exciting.” We proceed to rave over the new shade extensions for its widely coveted Rouge Volupté Shine Lipstick Balm." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The Black Opium Le Parfum is synergistic with Kravitz: a warm and spicy presence that mesmerizes the senses. For those who are familiar, the aroma is a more intense version of the Black Opium Eau de Parfum. I begin to think more about scents and wonder if a particular one reminds her of her mother. “Yeah—nagchampa,” Kravitz reveals of the incense that’s often burned to encourage a sacred space and meditative environment. “She’s always burning it in the house.” Nagchampa is made from a magnolia flower, sandalwood, and halmaddi, a tree resin. Combined, it has a sweet, musky scent." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "As I continue to sit with Kravitz in the large hotel room, she seems to relax more and more with each passing minute. We bond over being Black women, and it feels more like a friend catch-up than an interview. She shares the contact information for her hair braider with me (yes, the one that gives her those iconic microbraids), what scents remind her of her famous mother, and, despite all these years in the industry, how she remains authentically herself." +

    title: "The Nine Exhilarating Lives of Post-Punk Legend Gina Birch",
    author: "By Melissa Giannini",
    content:
      "As an incoming freshman at London’s Hornsey College of Art in the late 1970s, Gina Birch’s head was swimming with ideas. She’d fallen in love with performance art, land art, and film while growing up in Nottingham (of Robin Hood folklore) and was eager to experiment. “But when I arrived, the main area of buzz and excitement seemed to be around this new thing,” she told me in December, over eggs and pancakes at New York City’s Empire Diner." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Along with one of her classmates, Anna da Silva, Birch would embrace this “new thing” and form The Raincoats, a seminal post-punk band that has inspired countless musicians in its wake, from Kathleen Hanna to Sharon Van Etten (Birch recently illustrated a book of Van Etten’s lyrics). But today, she is in town to play a secret opening gig for Yo La Tengo’s annual Hanukkah residency at the Bowery Ballroom. And now, with the February 24 release of her first solo album, I Play My Bass Loud (via Third Man Records)—on the heels of a six-room solo painting exhibition, In My Fucking Room, late last year at London’s Gallery 46—Birch, 67, is experiencing only the latest of several career resurgences." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“The record is a series of thoughts and ideas I’ve jotted down over the years, some of which have mutated,” she says, while attempting to tame the wild strawberry-blonde hair that frames her face with her hands. (It doesn’t help that the temperature keeps alternating between arctic blast and humid tropics due to our diner booth’s proximity to the door, but it’s clear that Birch prefers things a bit messy—including her hairstyle. Fashion-wise, she’s a fan of “spots and stripes, short jackets, wearing things inside-out, and big shoes—like Minnie Mouse big.”)" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "I Play My Bass Loud’s title track opens the record, and is a fun, dub-heavy statement of purpose. “Wish I Was You” has a Breeders “Cannonball”-esque drum-and-feedback squall with guitar courtesy of Thurston Moore. Elsewhere in the effort (produced by Youth of Killing Joke) are echoes of ’60s girl groups and 2010s protest punk à la Pussy Riot." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The album’s cover, a relatively recent self-portrait featured in last year’s exhibition, depicts a young Birch screaming into a bathroom mirror opposite a kitchen sink full of dishes. It’s a scene from her time at art school, when she lived in a West London squat and “fell into a little enclave of what would be punk, I suppose,” she says. It was there that she met da Silva, a fellow student from Madeira, Portugal, and “two boys who were friends with The Clash’s roadie. We started going to lots and lots of gigs—the Sex Pistols, The Clash, Subway Sect, the Buzzcocks—just so many bands, and they were just fantastic. It was electric.”" +

    author: "By POOSH",
    content:
      "Let’s go girls! As we’ve talked about before, women encounter patronizing “tips” and stereotypes constantly when it comes to finances and money. This breeds confusion and shame and sends the message that finances are a masculine concern. Which is bullshit. Normalizing conversations about money and educating ourselves about finance is so important for women." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Financial literacy is being able to understand and use personal finance tools and fundamentals to build a healthy relationship with money. Without financial literacy, we become stuck in a cycle that limits our growth and opportunities and does the same for future generations. This is obviously a complex issue; below are just a few of the reasons why it’s important for women to be financially literate." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Lack of financial education holds women back " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The U.S. Department of Education says that 3.8 million American adult women have financial literacy skills below a basic level. “Women lacking competency in financial literacy face serious repercussions, such as taking on large amounts of credit card debt, defaulting on student loans, and experiencing difficulty managing income, taxes, and investments,” reports Annuity.org. That’s all pretty f*cking stressful, and it can mean a lifetime of chronic stress." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Additionally, financial insecurity is a main reason why women have trouble leaving abusive relationships and why they return to them. A recent report found that “improvements in women’s financial literacy can significantly reduce the rates of violence against women perpetrated by their male partners.”" +

    title: "Flared jeans used to scare me. Now I’m ready to rock them",
    author: "By Christian Allaire",
    content:
      "These days, you blink and there’s a new denim trend. One minute skinny jeans are out and super baggy is in. The next? Boot-cut is all the rage. It’s hard to keep up, but as someone who’s extremely denim obsessed, I must. I’ve tried just about every style over the years. But one silhouette that I’ve always steered clear from? Flares." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The thought of those ’70s-style bell-bottoms has always felt too cartoonish or retro for my own taste. Don’t get me wrong, I love the style—but any time I’ve tried on a pair of flared jeans, I’ve felt like I was wearing a Halloween costume or cosplaying as Mick Jagger. However, as we’re stepping into the new year, I’m tasking myself to dress outside my comfort zone (call it a style resolution), and wide-leg jeans are now at the top of the list. Lucky for me, the recent runways and street style scene prove that flares can work on just about anyone in 2022, whether in a casual or dressy context." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Where flared jeans were once associated with groovy, hippie-dippie style, they’re now a more sophisticated and polished denim option—the perfect alternative for overcoming my fear of looking like an extra in Saturday Night Fever. For spring 2023, for instance, Celine paired flares with sleek moto jackets; Altuzarra’s wide-leg jeans were styled with a cropped jacket and white blouse, striking the right combo between elegance and ease; and Dior even showed flares with a simple neutral tank, allowing the pants to shine totally on their own." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Style flared jeans with pieces with sharper structure instead of a cliché crochet or velvet top. A more minimalist top makes them feel way more mature and slick—not so kitschy. Recent street style photos prove the look is super wearable too. At the Pitti Uomo shows this past summer, photographer Style du Monde captured two stylish attendees who nailed flares this way: One wore them with a color-block button-up, the other a print vest and white tee. At the Copenhagen shows in August, another style star paired her flares with a heeled boot for height and piled on a denim jacket with a cinched waist. Again, the key here is structure on top!" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Suddenly, bell-bottoms don’t seem so scary after all. If you, like me, have a long-standing apprehension about floor-grazing jeans, now’s the time to try them out. There’s a bevy of options to shop now, from affordable H&M versions to luxe Gabriela Hearst styles. This year, you’ll catch me sporting them with fitted tees or sweaters and my go-to Cuban-heel boots—maybe even sleazy aviators, if I’m feeling saucy!" +

Goh recommends starting off with a sea salt spray to achieve the desired grip and texture for a hairstyle that can flawlessly carry you from main event to the after party. Contrary to other sprays, a sea salt infused spray makes all the difference. Even when struggling with flat hair, adding this to your morning routine can bring your crown back to life. By adding thickness and lending granular texture to your tresses, sea salt sprays make for easier styling—just some of the factors that make it a winning choice in his books." +

      "“It’s not a bag, it’s a baguette!” declared Sarah Jessica Parker’s Carrie Bradshaw infamously in 2000, cementing the Fendi Baguette as a pop-cultural icon. Created in 1997 and named after the way women would carry the French loaf of bread under their arms, the Baguette bag celebrated its 25th anniversary this September during New York Fashion Week. The celebration culminated in a blockbuster 53-look collection which paid homage to the unwavering appeal of the “It” bag, New York and the beauty of collaboration." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“I didn’t want to do a traditional ‘collection’ for the anniversary. Rather it’s a celebration of a time, of the moment the Baguette became famous.

      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Featuring collaborations with hallmarks of New York’s fashion scene, specifically Marc Jacobs, Tiffany & Co., Sarah Jessica Parker and Porter, the Baguette was interpreted in ways it had never been before." +

      "<br />" +
      "Ready-to-wear pieces from outerwear to skirts and accessories like hats and gaiters sported pockets that mimicked the proportions of the Baguette and featured the iconic double-F buckle. The bag itself, rightfully the star of the show, was reimagined in a dizzying plethora of colours, fabrications and sizes." +

      "The vision: A claustrophobically low ceiling with concrete slabs lining the entire show space created the opening narrative for the Prada show this season. As the ceiling raised, steel columns burgeoned and white flowers were sprawled all over as the classic heather grey sweater made its entrance paired with mid-length skirts covered in floral appliqué. The sheer simplicity of the show was helmed by the intricate details of blossoming flowers that delicately covered skirts or sprouted from the cleavage of toes—suggestive of how nature has its way of reproducing even in the harshest of environments. Shapes shifted from the long and lean to an almost couture-like bauble but all cleverly executed with much ease and vigour." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The vibe: There’s something really magical about a classical score being piped through the speakers at a show and today at Prada, we had a goosebump-inducing moment as ‘The Blue Danube Waltz’ by Johann Strauss was cleverly layered with the hippy rock tunes of ‘I Go To Sleep’ by The Kinks. The result? A hypnotic journey that gave the show an idyllic pace." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Signature style: Muted sweaters worn over full-length skirts with attached floral appliqué (Look 1) opened the show and quite quickly, the pullulating blooms made way to a series of strictly tailored shirt dresses that ended with a slinky trail (Look 9). The train—as favoured by both Miuccia and Raf—gave that touch of elegance to one of my favourite sections of the show, where white button-down coat dresses looked immaculate as the models walked towards the light (Look 43). There were some looks stolen from the recent men’s show that underscored the whole push towards a genderless wardrobe (Look 15). The show closed with louche slips completely covered in a graphic-like print (Look 50), giving a subtle nod to Miuccia’s very own collection from fall/winter 2015." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "What to shop from the collection: Those alien-looking pumps with sprouting stamens (Look 3) would add so much to an outfit while the classic Prada full skirt is a notable collector’s item through and through (Look 13). And because languid coat dresses are looking like a key trend for fall, I suggest you pick from amongst the series of white offerings that held their own mid-quarter way through the show (Look 40)." +

    author: "By Sarah Mower",
    content:
      "“In a sometimes judgmental world, our costumes can change who we want to be seen as, and who we are destined to be.” Florence Pugh, spotlit in a giant glittering silver-and-black halo hat, nailed the essence of the Harris Reed phenomenon in her introductory speech at his show at Tate Modern." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "As the entire fashion world knows, Harris is destined for Paris—he’ll be debuting at Nina Ricci imminently. So with this, only his fourth own-name collection since graduating from Central Saint Martins, and a Hollywood actor added to his growing fold of performer friends, he had a lot to celebrate—and a lot still to prove. He did it with a cinematically-lit circular procession of 10 black, gold, and silver, draped and swagged looks, and a theme centered on theatricality itself." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“All the world’s a stage,” he’d declared, earlier, quoting from Shakespeare’s As You Like It. “I’m someone who likes to play with grandeur and performative clothing. So I loved how in William Shakespeare, back in the day—even though it was different—men are dressing like women. This constant gender play for me felt very aligned with the brand.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The American side of his consciousness, he added, also locked onto the idea of beauty pageants. In a further plot-twist, the swathes of gold lame, used to create panniers, wired stoles, and domed crinolines, were actually made from reclaimed theatre curtains from all over London. They glimmered glamorously alongside the glinting silver sequins of the harlequin bodysuits." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The look-book photos provided for Vogue Runway capture all the drama and the detail of the silhouettes, but not the fact that this was the first Harris Reed show which successfully broke the mold of his early tableaux presentations, and allowed the models to walk. That was, literally, a step forward—although, in these days of ever more wildly competitive event dressing, the willingness of celebrities to carry the vast and vertiginous on their bodies makes practicality and comfort almost cease to matter." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Harris Reed as a custom business makes total sense when he has loyal friends and is working in a zeitgeist where entertainment and fashion have fused. Up next, we’ll be seeing what he brings to Paris, in what is traditionally a more ready-to-wear environment. Harry Styles already famously walked out the first Harris Reed for Nina Ricci tuxedo suit—a preview that already broke with the womenswear tradition of the brand. Whatever happens, the excitement around that launch is guaranteed to blow up Paris fashion week." +

Glenn Martens led the charge on the first evening at Diesel: where bold, ferocious explorations of denim were mixed into sexually evocative silhouettes and prints.

      "It’s official: Pharrell Williams is the next designer of Louis Vuitton Men’s. In a move that will shake up the luxury menswear landscape, and mark a new era of celebrity fashion designers, the global celebrity and fashion aficionado has been tapped by Louis Vuitton parent company LVMH to take over the job held by Virgil Abloh before his death in late 2021. Pharrell’s debut collection will be unveiled in Paris in June. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "In a statement, Pietro Beccari, Louis Vuitton’s Chairman and CEO characterised Pharrell’s appointment as a homecoming. “I am glad to welcome Pharrell back home, after our collaborations in 2004 and 2008 for Louis Vuitton, as our new Men’s Artistic Director. His creative vision beyond fashion will undoubtedly lead Louis Vuitton towards a new and very exciting chapter.” " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Pharrell has a long history of collaborating with luxury brands, including Louis Vuitton. In 2007, he collaborated with then-Vuitton creative director Marc Jacobs on a line of sunglasses, which were re-issued by Abloh—a Pharrell friend and collaborator—2018. Pharrell has also designed splashy collaborations with Chanel and Moncler, which will unveil a new Pharrell-branded collection this weekend in London. He also has a longstanding partnership with Adidas Originals and recently launched a skincare line, Humanrace. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "For decades, Pharrell has articulated a hyper-modern sense of style that now resonates deeply with a new generation of fashion fans. “When you listen to yourself and you're comfortable in who you are, you wear what you feel like fits and looks right on you. And that's it,” he told GQ in 2019, when he fronted the New Masculinity Issue wearing a ballgown puffer. Two decades ago, as the frontman of N.E.R.D., he broke the mold of hip-hop style by integrating elements of skateboarder-wear. His evolving sensibility eventually predicted the rise of gender-neutral clothing when he embraced womenswear designs by then-Céline creative director Phoebe Philo, and he became the first man to appear in a Chanel ad in 2017. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The ties between Pharrell and LVMH have seemingly tightened in recent years. LVMH installed Pharrell’s creative consigliere, the Japanese producer and designer Nigo, at the helm of Kenzo in 2021. Pharrell and Nigo’s intertwined careers go back to the early-2000s, when the duo founded the deeply influential streetwear brand Billionaire Boys Club, and Pharrell is now a regular front row presence at Kenzo shows. He has also recently been sporting custom diamond-encrusted shades he designed with Tiffany & Co., LVMH’s latest luxury brand acquisition. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Installing Pharrell at Louis Vuitton Men’s would be the denouement of the LVMH strategy to turn its luxury brands into global pop cultural movements. Louis Vuitton’s collaboration with Yayoi Kusama has seen cities around the world blanketed in the Japanese designer’s polka dots, and the most recent Louis Vuitton Men’s show featured a Rosalía performance that had little to do with the clothes, but everything to do with creating a massive social media moment. That collection featured pieces guest-designed by Colm Dillane of KidSuper, which put Dillane in the pole position to snag the creative director gig. But LVMH is perhaps thinking bigger, and employing a turnaround strategy similar to the one employed at Tiffany. LVMH’s re-launch of Tiffany began with a Beyoncé- and Jay-Z-fronted campaign, and has since gone on to include Pharrell himself. When asked by WWD about the custom diamond sunglasses, Pharrell hinted that they were merely the first look at a long-term partnership. “Tiffany and I are engaged,” he told WWD, stating that he and the NYC-based jeweller had “many things” in the works.

      "Tiffany’s Executive Vice President of Products and Communication, Alexandre Arnault, son of LVMH founder Bernard Arnault, has made it a point to attract a younger consumer, specifically focusing on celebrity-led activations, which began with the brand’s About Love campaign which contracted Beyoncé and Jay Z as ambassadors." +

      "Tiffany has since featured a roster of celebrities in its ads, including Gal Gadot, Hailey Bieber, Zoe Kravitz, Janelle Monae and Elle Fanning to name but a few.

      "Attracting a younger customer to buy into a heritage jeweller that needs dusting off is no mean feat. To make it appealing beyond the Americas is another challenge. Mr Arnault and his marketing team have also gone the obvious route of streetwear collaborations, taking a note out of Louis Vuitton and Fendi’s playbooks, and dropping co-labs with Supreme, once the ultimate underground skater brand, and now Nike." +

      "<br />" +
      "To an older generation, Tiffany is known for its pearls, lockets and blue boxes, and that’s the image it is keen to shed. “We’re trying, little by little, to take advantage of everything Tiffany has been doing over the last 200 years as the only American luxury brand, and bring it into the current moment, making it part of cultural zeitgeist” Mr Arnault said." +

    author: "By André-Naquian Wheeler",
    content:
      "I remember the first time I took note of the balaclava. It was a little over a year ago, at a crowded house party in deep Brooklyn. A lanky, twenty-something man wore a bright orange balaclava—despite the tropical microclimate created by all the packed, dancing bodies. He took nonchalant sips from a red Solo cup, mesmerizingly comfortable in his anonymity. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "At that time, I viewed the moment as eccentric and kooky. Who wears a balaclava if they’re not in the arctic or planning a heist? Though balaclavas—also known as ski masks—have been popular for a long time in frigid locales such as Eastern and Northern Europe, they weren’t as common in a city like New York. But perhaps their relative out-of-placeness is what made them a great candidate for trend-forward New York style. Colorful, striped balaclavas like the ones sold by Marni and Ella Emhoff catches your eye, but also obscures the identity of the wearer. It places all your attention on the clothes, not the person. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "But then balaclavas went from an intriguing rarity to a bubbling trend. When I walked my French bulldog around my former neighborhood of Bed-Stuy, foolhardy daredevils would zip by on motorcycles and four-wheelers and perform their tricks while wearing a balaclava." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Not too long after, during the first wave of the Omicron-variant in December of 2021, balaclavas served as multi-purpose facemasks. They also infiltrated rap culture seemingly overnight around this time, too. Drill rappers such as Tion Wayne and SL wore ski masks throughout their music videos and performances. Nicki Minaj even started selling some for $40 after she rapped about the trending accessory in a hard-edged collaboration with rapper Lil Baby. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Suddenly, it seemed as if a particular sect of hip hop culture—and its passionate, creative fans—had taken a special liking to balaclavas. As Brooklyn rapper Lola Brooke explains of the phenomenon, “In Brooklyn, we know what will be the biggest fashion statements before it takes off!” " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "These days, the balaclava is as likely to be spotted in deep Bushwick as it is in, say, a Paris Fashion Week show or a trendy bar in downtown Manhattan. They have been spotted on the runways of an ever-growing list of shows, spanning both menswear and womenswear: Marni, Loewe, Y-Project, Kenzo, Simone Rocha, and more. The latest Louis Vuitton menswear collection—created with Colm Dillan of KidSuper—featured a selection of leather and latex balaclavas paired with meeting-ready suits and overcoats. British designer Marine Serre upped the ante by selling masks that even cover the nose and mouth, leaving only the eyes exposed and creating something more primed for, say, Rihanna’s iconic “S&M” visual.

    title: "Why I’m Here for the Return of Big Belt Buckles",
    author: "By Christian Allaire",
    content:
      "The craze for Y2K fashion over the past few years has left many divided. While some were fully on board with the revival of trucker hats, low-rise jeans, and bedazzled logo tees, others were horrified at the thought of Juicy Couture tracksuits and dresses over jeans coming back into the fray. The decade’s trends may be polarizing, but at least they weren’t boring. Looking back at photos from the time period, I was struck by just how many stars wore one particular statement accessory on the red carpet: the big, bold belt. Preferably with a buckle so big you could see it from space. But guess what? It’s creeping its way back onto the runways too. I’m fully on board with it. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Now, as someone who grew up as a teenager in the aughts, I’ll admit that I always have a soft spot for the era’s fashions. The sleazy, gaudy aesthetic reminds me of simpler times when celebrities had fun with what they wore and didn’t take themselves too seriously. The honking belt buckle—frequently paired with low-slung jeans and baby tees—is a fun little treat for your outfit. One of my favorite examples is when Jennifer Lopez performed on TRL wearing a bejeweled heart belt buckle, paired with a bedazzled top and jeans. You can’t tell me it didn’t instantly tie her outfit together! See also: stars like Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, and all three members of Destiny’s Child." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Today, these belts can feel a little too costumey or retro. But as evidenced at the fall 2023 menswear shows this past month, there are ways to make them look cool and current. Just pair the belts with pieces that are more subdued, allowing the brazen accessory to shine on its own. Gucci’s new “GG” style elevated a classic tee and jeans pairing; Kenzo’s gold logo added a dash of fierceness to a utilitarian green ensemble. That’s not to say you can’t lean into a cheekier pairing, though: At Dsquared2, for instance, an “I Love Beer” belt was paired with a “Choke” tee—a riff on a Coca-Cola tee, of course." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Considering fashion is currently in a state of sleek minimalism—call it a reset after the wild Barbiecore and Y2K trends last year—I’d argue the kitschy belt is the perfect piece to keep a bit of last year’s raucous energy going. I’ve always been one to gravitate toward excess. Even so, you can pair it with your new discreetly luxurious The Row sweater and jeans, and your outfit will instantly go from wallflower to the life of the party. It’s an easy way to inject your look with personality. Oh, and there’s also the added bonus that it keeps your pants up—not an insignificant detail. " +

    author: "By Hannah Coates",
    content:
      "Ozempic is a hot topic right now. An injectable drug that was originally intended to treat Type 2 diabetes, it is—somewhat controversially—now being used as a weight loss aid. “Ozempic is a semaglutide, which is used to treat diabetes and has been very effective for weight loss,” explains New York-based facial plastic surgeon Dr. Jennifer Levine. “It works by causing the pancreas to secrete more insulin and decreases the amount of glucagon produced by the liver, which suppresses appetite and slows down gastric motility, so you feel full for longer. It’s very popular in Hollywood.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "While the ins and outs of Ozempic use are a topic for another time—read Vogue’s explainer for more detail—it is a related skin malady that we bring to you today. “Ozempic face” is the new skin concern on the block, as dermatologists and aesthetic doctors globally begin to see the effects that losing a lot of weight can have on your face—and quickly at that. One user told The New York Times that her “body looked great, but my face looked exhausted and old” after using the drug." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“Rapid weight loss leads to volume loss in the face, but can also affect the collagen and elastin in the skin,” says Dr. Levine. “Ozempic face can look gaunt, deflated, and saggy. Think raisin as opposed to grape!” The face and skin appearing hollow, droopy, and lax are all common hallmarks of Ozempic face—all key ingredients in the recipe for accelerated aging. According to aesthetic doctor Dr. Sophie Shotter, however, it is worth noting that it is not the drug itself that is responsible for these skin changes, but speedy weight loss. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“With rapid weight loss, the skin struggles to ‘shrink’ around your new shape, which means there can be excess facial skin that feels more lax and pinchable,” she explains. “Having some facial fat definitely helps us age better, and people with more fat also tend to have fewer wrinkles.” Conversely, excess facial fat is also problematic and can create heavy lines, such as marionettes (around the mouth) on the face. Balanced weight is, as ever, the best companion to healthier-looking skin. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "For those that are suffering with Ozempic face, there are in-clinic treatments that can help. “I would combine some form of skin tightening treatment, such as Sofwave or Profound RF, which can help boost collagen and elastin levels to help the skin contract around the new facial form, with facial fillers, which strategically restore volume and make skin look healthy and proportionate to the rest of the patient,” says Dr. Shotter. She is also a fan of biostimulators, such as HArmonyCa, which employs cross-linked hyaluronic acid to immediately lift and volumize, and calcium hydroxyapatite, to stimulate collagen production and improve skin laxity over time." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Dr. Levine takes a similar treatment protocol, but also likes to include devices such as Ultherapy and EmFace to help lift, improve sagging, and stimulate collagen and elastin production. “In extreme cases,” she says, “a face or neck lift may be needed to address the laxity.” " +

      "The sun is en route, and with it, a hairstyle that is every bit as light and breezy as the spring season. The chunky bob is a flattering, super cool cut that has a carefree feel to it, making it an ideal style to try as the warmer months roll in. " +

      "“This bob is defined by its chunky edge,” explains Luke Hersheson, who says the style is super popular in his salon right now. “It doesn’t look razored (although it might be), and it has a blocky weight to the ends. Often it also kicks out a bit at the ends, which gives it a kind of softness.”" +

      "Hailey Bieber is a recent convert to the style, and other stars who have sported it over the years include Kaia Gerber, Selena Gomez, Romy Schneider, Kelly McGillis (see the original Top Gun), and Christy Turlington, who has also given excellent chunky bob in her time." +

This is a straighter, chunkier, heavier bob. It’s simple and more graphic than some other styles.”" +

      "<br />" +
      "Super low-maintenance and easy to wear, if it’s cut right, it requires very little styling. However, there are easy ways to switch it up if you desire, so it’s versatile too. As well as playing with your parting placement—chunky bobs look as excellent worn in a side parting as they do with a center part—try injecting some movement into mid-lengths and ends with texturizing spray or volumizing mousse, like the Hair by Sam McKnight’s new Cool Girl Volume Foam. For a sleek finish, smooth flyaways with Fable & Mane’s Smooth and Shine Hair Oil. " +

      "Thoroughly cleansing and hydrating the skin with a rich, yet weightless moisturizer like Lancôme’s Hydra Zen sets the stage for a smooth canvas, says makeup artist Nick Barose, who counts Lupita Nyong’o, Priyanka Chopra, and Rachel Weisz as clients. “Before big red carpets, I use warm washcloths to scrub away dry patches,” he says. Or, if there’s time, makeup artist Vincent Oquendo encourages clients to use Dr. Barbara Sturm’s Facial Scrub or REN’s Flash Rinse One-Minute Facial for an allover flake-free glow before slicking the skin with Georgia Louise’s Vital Finishing Serum for an extra dose of moisture. “It absorbs and doesn’t overload the skin, so your concealer doesn’t slip all over the place,” says Oquendo." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "And if you’ll be wearing foundation as well, Barose suggests applying that first and all over—even under the eyes. “If you use too much, it makes what you’re trying to hide look even more obvious,” he explains. “This way you see that you don’t need as much concealer as you think.”" +

      "Every time we open our TikTok app, we’re inundated with a new beauty trend users can’t stop raving about. While many aren’t worth a second thought, the “Botox in a bottle” videos left us wanting to know more. Though we’re in full support of people heading to an expert for whatever cosmetic treatments suit their fancy, we’re intrigued that there might be a needle-free method right at home. So, we tapped three dermatologists to weigh in." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "What Is “Botox in a Bottle”?" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“The phrase ‘Botox in a bottle’ is a term popularized on TikTok for topical products with antiaging properties that aim to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on the face,” Libby explains. Essentially, these promote wrinkle-reducing, plumping, and firming benefits to reveal smooth, radiant skin. According to Shirazi, topicals work at the cellular level to enhance skin’s natural biology. “They boost vital structures like collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid as well as hydrating skin cells, enhancing cell turnover, and supporting the skin barrier,” she says." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "What Ingredients Should You Look For?" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "To start, Engelman suggests that maintaining skin barrier hydration is essential to retaining plump, bouncy skin, as dehydrated skin exaggerates signs of aging. “Hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, squalane, and niacinamide are key, as are ingredients that improve the skin’s ability to hold onto moisture, like ceramides and peptides,” she instructs." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Aside from hydrators, our experts emphasize the importance of utilizing ingredients that spur the production of collagen and elastin in the skin, as well as agents that protect and repair skin damage. Retinol, retinol alternatives, matrixyl, argireline, peptides, exfoliants, and antioxidants should be incorporated to see lasting results. And if it’s not said enough, Shirazi shares again the importance of daily sun protection." +

    author: "By Monica Kim",
    content:
      "On a cool January morning, a model sits beneath a Korean pine tree in the northwest of Seoul, the gravity-defying lengths of her hair mimicking the uneven growth of branches above her head. On either side, embellishing those rolling waves, are two mother-of-pearl inlay intricately cut to show the soaring herons and flowers often seen in old paintings. Any Seoul-based creative will instantly recognize the work as belonging to Gabe Sin, the incredible and iconoclastic hair designer best known for drawing references from Korean history and culture and transforming them into whimsical wearable pieces. “I have a lot of interest in old Korean art,” he says. “I try to express the most Korean things.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Born in Seoul in the 1980s, Sin has always been based in the capital city and maintains a small studio in Itaewon, where he spends hours dreaming up and crafting his show-stopping hair sculptures. Naturally, the room is filled with extensions and wigs, but also flowers, boxes of starch (used to firm up the hair), jugs of resin (to preserve the pieces), and countless trinkets he gathers on meandering walks around Seoul’s sprawling wholesale markets" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Of course, there is plenty of pearl, which Sin sources from jagae (mother of pearl) craft shops around the city. Each jagae hair piece takes him about one week and is painstaking to make. His work nods to the 2000-year-old craft technique called najeonchilgi, in which mother of pearl is inlaid onto decorative boxes, cabinets, or other objets d’art scattered about the home. Growing up, Sin’s grandmother’s house was filled with these pieces; thus, it holds personal meaning. “It’s a work that began from a place of familiarity or longing,” he explains. “I started from the idea that what felt sentimental to me would feel the same to others.”" +

      "Sydney Sweeney is pretty much the epitome of the modern bombshell. And though, for much of her career, that lean has come with an expected shade of bombshell blonde, her shift toward deeper, more natural hues in recent months has us rethinking the stereotype. For the premiere of her new film, Reality, Sweeney opted for a soft, taffy blonde blowout finished with parted bohemian bangs that proved the power of natural tones, even (or especially) in a red carpet setting." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“We colored her hair late last year for the GQ Awards in London, but since then, the color had faded, and we just wanted to add some gold to richen everything up without taking her too much darker,” says hairstylist Glen Coco Oropeza, who used a combination of Wella hair color in 9/3 ‘Very Light Blonde’ and 10/3 ‘Lightest Blonde/Gold’ to brighten up Sweeney’s brunette. The result was a subtle, organic balance to her embellished (and entirely Jessica Rabbit-esque) crimson Miu Miu. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "For his part, Oropeza believes that healthy hair is beautiful hair. “I really love when people are close to their natural hair color but with a little bit of dimension,” he says. “I think we are born with the color we are meant to have and the color that suits our skin tone, so adding a little enhancement with some dimension that is 1-2 shades lighter or darker than your natural is the perfect addition to still feel like yourself.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Sweeney has noted that her switch to blonde—a shift that came with *Euphoria—*helped uplevel her career, ramping up her recognizability and securing her roles. Now, though, Sweeney’s star power is such that she can pare back and find her bombshell in whatever aesthetic makes her (and her hair) feel the best. “There was this complex where no one really knew me as brunette Syd, and I didn’t really book as much as I did when I was blonde—but I’m back to brunette because the blonde was killing my hair, and I needed to grow it out a little bit,” she told Yahoo Life. “I kind of feel like I’m myself again.”" +

    author: "By Emma Specter",
    content:
      "When Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, many touted medication abortion—a nonsurgical procedure that involves taking a pill called mifepristone to stop the pregnancy from progressing, followed by a pill called misoprostol to empty the uterus—as a potential saving grace for those seeking abortions in states that would no longer provide in-person surgical procedures." +
      "<br />" +

      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Wildly enough, the outcome of one Texas lawsuit could end up affecting the availability of medication abortions across the country. Last November, the Alliance for Defending Freedom, a conservative Christian legal advocacy group, filed a lawsuit against the FDA on behalf of the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, a coalition of physicians who oppose abortion, alleging that the FDA’s procedures for approving the drugs were out of date. Should Trump-appointed US District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk rule in favor of the plaintiffs, he could “grant an emergency injunction that would revoke the FDA’s approval of mifepristone nationwide,” according to Newsweek, affecting nearly 65 million women of reproductive age. Kacsmaryk is due to make his decision by February 24. " +

      "“The Romaine wedge salad, please. With the white anchovy and egg. No mayo.” £34. I’ve been coming to places like this now for three years. Before that I went to mid-chain restaurants. And before that I ate at fast food chains. And yes indeed the surroundings have changed, but my economic prospects haven’t. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Okay, that’s not quite true. My wages got a little bigger, and so I spent a little more. I started to split the bill equally, even if I only had one glass of wine but the table got two bottles. A decade ago, I would calculate exactly what my friends and I had eaten, and I’d cry injustice if someone underpaid. I’d deem them a traitor, a sort of local Jeff Bezos, and it’d take me a while to have dinner with them again—if ever. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "But here I am, in one of the more expensive restaurants in the city and all I have, financially speaking, is two maxed out credit cards, an empty checking account, and a ton of student debt. I don’t own a house, I don’t have any savings, but, perhaps most pressingly, I don’t really know how I’ll pay for dinner tonight. My parents don’t have any money, and my friends who do seem to think it is right and just that they would invest their profits or their inheritances rather than send me five thousand to lift me out of debt. Fair enough, I guess. Many of those friends, too, have spotted me for dinner when I can’t pay for myself." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "I work really hard. Everyone in my life knows that. But not much work with a soul pays the big bucks these days, and fictional characters and outdated ideas taught me how to manage my money: Carrie Bradshaw isn’t real, and the generation preceding mine had free education and a reasonable housing market. You don’t need me to tell you that the rich have gotten richer and richer over the past several decades, while it’s gotten harder and harder for most of us to maintain a perch in the middle class. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "And now I am paying to keep up with people I was never meant to keep up with. My card won’t be declined at the end of the meal, but the moment I get on the bus I’ll receive a text from my bank saying I am at my financial limit. And so a salad will cost my mental health, until I next get paid. Guess it isn’t worth that much anyway, financially speaking. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "I’ve become a master at brushing this off. It’s not the first time it’s happened, and it won’t be the last. Once again I will go home from dinner and try to apply for two loans and be rejected from both. " +

    content:
      "Like so many people my age, I harbor complicated feelings toward Paris Hilton and the general concept of femininity—and for similar reasons. Both lure you in with the promise of glamour and ease, but can ultimately leave you feeling cold and wondering why you blew half your rent on a dress you’ll never wear. (Or, in the case of the families who invited Hilton and her onetime sidekick Nicole Richie to live and work with them on The Simple Life, why on earth you trusted a toxically rich and very obviously lazy socialite to milk your cow.)" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "What I’ve slowly come to realize over the years is that the trappings of traditional femininity have to be applied in specific, strategic doses so as not to make me itchy—i.e., no to bachelorette parties, but yes to getting a manicure and gossiping with the nail tech while the polish dries. The same, it seems, can be said of the Hilton persona; though I wouldn’t necessarily want to hang with Paris 24/7 (not, it should be said, that she’s offering), I am very interested in her Amazon homeware line, which is on sale now." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Before you raise an eyebrow, hear me out: Everything in the collection, from the pastel mini fridge to the rhinestone-encrusted thermos and the sold-out “That’s hot” tea kettle, is tacky and pink and over-the-top and proto-Barbiecore…and I weirdly kind of love it. It’s like someone fell asleep at the front desk of the Madonna Inn and let you raid the kitchen, something that has been a dream of mine ever since I first glimpsed the inside of that historic (and frilly) California hotel." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Though I’d be less inclined to subject my bedroom or living room to this kind of hot pink assault on the senses, I’ve long felt that kitchenware could use a little femme-forward makeover (a desire related only in part to my 10-year-strong longing for the pink Le Creuset dutch oven of my dreams). Who decided that toasters and microwaves and even spatulas had to be standard-issue and drab? Why can’t they be fun? To be clear, I’m not arguing that turning my entire kitchen Paris Hilton–pink is any kind of feminist statement; if anything, the “pink tax” levied on products marketed towards women, such as razors, tampons, and shampoo, is evidence of the sexism that still unfairly divides our society, even in 2023. Still, rather than pay more for bad shampoo just because it’s got a cute, girly label, I long to stack my home with inexplicably femme appliances specifically because…well, they thrill the lizard part of my brain that still misses playing with dolls. That’s something, isn’t it?" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Honestly, I’m (probably) not going to buy anything from the Paris Hilton homeware line, if only because my ugly, functional, non-pink pots and pans are perfectly good, and I, unlike the newly minted domestic goddess in question, am not an heiress. I am moving soon, though, and if I somehow manage to come in under budget (not likely), maybe I’ll treat myself to a limited-edition baby pink wine chiller. Now that—ironically—would be hot." +

    author: "By Marley Marius",
    content:
      "Ever since the release of her chart-topping, critically beloved debut record, Baduizm, in 1997, Erykah Badu has been a force to reckon with. The intervening years have seen her win four Grammy Awards, release four more studio albums, become a doula, give an incredible Tiny Desk Concert, and—most recently—emerge as something of a fashion plate, striding the cobblestone runway at Vogue World: New York and ascending the Met Gala red carpet in Thom Browne and Marni. And yet, all the while, Badu has maintained an air of almost magical mystery about her; a not-quite-of-this-world-ness, despite being born and bred in Texas. So, in honor of her gloriously sunlit March Vogue cover, we’re breaking down five things you might not know about the soul icon. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Her stage name has ancient (and musical) origins" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "A Dallas native, Erykah Badu was born Erica Abi Wright on February 26, 1971. The “kah” in her stage name refers to an ancient Egyptian term for one’s soul or “inner self,” while “ba-du” is her favorite jazz-scat sound." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Her most indelible hit was created live on stage" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Before it became an actual song, “Tyrone,” Badu’s infectious (and hilarious) 1997 break-up anthem, was a riff that Badu’s band just played for fun. “When we would be in rehearsal, we would do this one groove, which was ‘Tyrone,’ the music, but I would sing different funny things over it,” Badu told Mark Ronson on The Fader Uncovered podcast in 2021. “So I was onstage, and my keyboard player, Norman Keys Hurts, starts playing the melody from rehearsal, and I was like, ‘Okay,’ and ‘Call Tyrone’ was born on that stage.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "As a doula, she’s worked with both celebrity friends and perfect strangers" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Since coaching a friend through her 52-hour labor some 20 years ago, Badu has become a trusted doula and certified midwife to many, including model Slick Woods and singers Summer Walker and Teyana Taylor. Yet you needn’t have a famous name to seek her help: According to writer Kate Branch (another satisfied client), Badu has also worked with “relatives, and even a woman she met in Whole Foods once.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "She’s at the center of a sprawling blended family" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Badu herself has had three children: son Seven Sirius Benjamin, with André 3000 of OutKast (whose song “Ms. Jackson” was inspired by Badu and her mother); daughter Puma Sabti Curry, with rapper the D.O.C.; and Mars Merkaba Thedford, with rapper Jay Electronica. Although she has never married, she remains close with all three men. “I’m nowhere near a single mom,” she told The New Yorker in 2016. “I mean, I am, but the fathers are always here.” " +

      "He’s been making beds squeak for nearly three decades now, but more recently he’d been stuck in a creative rut – that was until he found himself spiritually renewed thanks to a Las Vegas residency that’s become a sex-soaked smash" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "When Usher first arrived in Las Vegas two years ago for a stint of shows at Caesars Palace, it had been six years and one and a half albums since he’d done a full tour. But because he is Usher, he quickly shook off any stage rust and transformed himself into one of the most sought-after performers in a town already overflowing with sought-after performers. The Caesars show was such a crazy success that he’d soon parlay it into an even bigger Vegas residency – sweaty, theatrical, lascivious; extremely Usher – down the street at the Park MGM, where he became one of the most dedicated employees on their payroll. And, it turns out, he kind of loves having a job." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "So it’s on a chilly night in December that MGM is throwing its annual company Christmas party, about 15 minutes off the Strip in an otherwise bland event space. A Hallmark-movie-handsome singer is belting out jazz standards to a tipsy audience of Gen Xers who are doing the office-party two-step. And inside the glass foyer, between the double doors into the space and another set of double doors outside, is Usher, who is trying to get into the party and – at least for the moment – can’t. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "He’s the world-famous singer of a dozen club anthems and a dozen more crooning, desirous ballads, but tonight the superstar is politely waiting at the door. Across eight studio albums, Usher is one of the defining artists of the ’90s and the noughties. His music is for house parties, clubs, breakups, grind trains, and affairs. From his sophomore album, My Way, on, he has become almost synonymous with both a good lay and a good time. He performed at both of Obama’s inauguration concerts and introduced the world to a shy Canadian teen named Justin Bieber. But in the 2010s his output mellowed, and he seemed to disappear from the spotlight. At least before he found himself again, here in Sin City." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Apparently, there had been some miscommunication. Usher was invited to the Christmas party by MGM’s top brass. Someone said Usher was going to come, then someone said Usher wasn’t going to come, and then, hours later, Usher and his entourage of three (plus me) materialised at the entrance. (Every time I have fantasised about going to a party with a famous, intensely desired man – which is often, because I am a dreamer and also a Leo – it has never played out like this.) It’s freezing in this lobby-atrium-foyer thing, but Usher is flashing a dimpled smile. He’s wearing a bouclé overcoat with a puffer vest and T-shirt underneath; his hair is chartreuse blond. Diamonds, each the size of an AirPod, are lodged in his ears via conch piercings. We are talking to a frazzled woman with a drink in her hand who is trying to figure out what the hell to do with us.

      "Liam Neeson picked marriage over playing James Bond in 1995's GoldenEye",
    author: "By Jack King",
    content:
      "He might now be the reigning king of the shoot ‘em up B-movie, starring in the revenge-driven Taken franchise, but Liam Neeson could’ve jumped on the action wagon far earlier — and as one of Britain's most iconic pop culture figures, no doubt. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Neeson revealed that he was contacted “a couple of times” by franchise producer Barbara Broccoli in the ‘90s, following his Oscar-nominated success with Schindler’s List, about portraying the world's most famous double-O, James Bond. So what stopped him?" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "According to Neeson, his wife and fellow actor Natasha Richardson played a pivotal role in his decision-making. “I know the Broccolis. They looked at a bunch of actors,” Neeson said. “Schindler’s List had come out and Barbara [Broccoli] had called me a couple of times to ask if I was interested, and I said, ‘Yes, I would be interested.’ And then my lovely wife [Natasha Richardson], God rest her soul, said to me while we were shooting Nell down in the Carolinas, ‘Liam, I want to tell you something: If you play James Bond, we’re not getting married.'”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "So 1995's GoldenEye ultimately ended up going to Neeson's fellow Irishman, Pierce Brosnan, and the rest is history. (Sidenote: just imagine, now, Liam Neeson's face rendered in blocky N64 form for Rare's GoldenEye couch shooter.) He picked love over the license to kill — a decision that Bond himself would take another 26 years to make, with the conclusion of Daniel Craig's No Time to Die. “I would tease her by going behind her back, making my fingers as though I'm holding a gun, and then [hums the James Bond theme],” he continued. “I loved doing that shit!”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "It was a Bond ultimatum, but one that paid dividends with a decade and a half of marriage up to Richardson's untimely passing in 2009. “And she meant [the ultimatum]! Come on, there are all those gorgeous girls in various countries getting into bed and getting out of bed. I'm sure a lot of her decision-making was based on that!”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Neeson did sink his teeth into proper franchise fare later in the ‘90s with his starring part as Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars revival The Phantom Menace, reprising the role for a brief end-of-season cameo in Disney+’s Obi-Wan Kenobi series. That'll be it for now though, it seems, with the actor snubbing the idea of his own spin-off show in conversation with Watch What Happens Live! Asked if he was interested in portraying Qui-Gon again, he said: “No, I'm not. There are so many spin-offs of Star Wars. It's diluting it to me, and it's taken away the mystery and the magic in a weird way.” One payday is enough, I guess." +

      "Mindhunter is the serial killer drama the world should have tuned into, not Dahmer",
    author: "By Lucy Ford",
    content:
      "According to Netflix's self-reported viewing figures, the world couldn't get enough of Jeffrey Dahmer. Ryan Murphy's Dahmer - Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story, starring Evan Peters as the notoriously gruesome serial killer, racked up over a billion hours of viewership when it launched in 2022, prompting as much praise as it did ire and fast-tracking Murphy's plan to make exploring, in explicit detail, the lives of famous serial killers his next anthology series." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Five years earlier, Netflix gave us an alternative deep dive into the world of serial killers with David Fincher's Mindhunter. Rather than living in the minds and lives of the world's most notorious murderers, it gave us the point of view of FBI agents (played by Jonathan Groff, Holt McCallany and Anna Torv) at the inception of the behavioural science unit, which used the testimonies of incarcerated serial killers to develop profiles for catching ones still out in the wild. The series lasted for two seasons, but where Dahmer was immediately greenlit for more upon release, Mindhunter's future languished in ambiguity until Fincher finally revealed that the series was too expensive to be viable with the number of viewers it courted. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Since its official cancellation, the circle of discourse has followed a classic trend. Cult favourite series is axed because of middling views, prompting widespread, vocal anger and petitions to u-turn the decision. Whether Netflix was aware or not, the consensus is that they just canned their best show. While the backlash is, undeniably, warranted, Fincher's revelation that the viewership just wasn't strong enough sets the decision in stone. What's frustrating about that reality, compared to Dahmer's later stellar success, is that Mindhunter got everything right about telling true crime stories where Dahmer got it wrong. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Dahmer is everything the ravenous societal appetite for true crime craves. The unfiltered, unglossed, stomach-churning visualisation of human depravity. That insatiable hunger for horror is bolstered by a streaming culture of binging, something that Fincher's slow-paced series railed against. The crimes of Dahmer, who raped, murdered and dismembered 17 men and boys during his reign of terror in the 80s, is a well-worn story. His murderous exploits litter hundreds of podcasts, multiple film and TV adaptations and, prior to Murphy's series dropping, Netflix released Conversations with a Killer: The Jeffrey Dahmer Tapes, a docuseries containing explicit and graphic interviews with the killer. To put it bluntly, we simply didn't need to see or hear any more about Dahmer, but Murphy did it anyway and, in typical Murphy style, didn't scrimp on the violence. With the claim that it's shedding light on ignored LGBTQ+ victims, it's shock horror disguised as social commentary." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "While there are valid conversations about whether any mining of true crime stories can be ethical, Mindhunter toed the line and came out unscathed from much controversy. That was due, in large part, to the series' purposeful decision to barely show the violence perpetrated by the serial killers it portrayed, including Ed Kemper, who killed young college girls and the women in his immediate family, Richard Speck, the notorious nurse killer and Charles Manson. Their horrors are lingered on through speech, the mundanity of the way their crimes are excavated leaving a much bigger sense of threat than any blood splatter Dahmer could show. Mindhunter's understanding of true crime comes in what we don't see, and the notion that understanding why and how people hurt each other is far more troubling than seeing it in all its bloody perversion. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Some fans of Dahmer and true crime will say their enjoyment of this particular product of the genre is a kind of necessary exposure therapy, of needing to see how far people can go in order to protect themselves. That's simply not true, as Mindhunter proved time and time again across two seasons. Its conversations with and about killers were petrifying, sparing no details in the narrative but, kindly, leaving them off the screen. The impact of murder was told through the aftereffects of a society tarnished by brutality, rather than through seeing the life literally leave someone's eyes. The fact the family members of Dahmer's victims had such vocal criticism of the series is enough to show any supposed necessary visual understanding of his horror comes at the expense of someone else.

    title: "Diane Kruger on the Mysterious Pleasures of the Femme Fatale",
    author: "By Erik Morse",
    content:
      "In the opening scene of Neil Jordan’s new hardboiled throwback film Marlowe, a sumptuously costumed Diane Kruger saunters into the office of private investigator Philip Marlowe (a haggard, chain-smoking Liam Neeson) with a request to find a Hollywood paramour who may or may not have disappeared. “When you say ‘disappeared,’ do you mean out of your life or out of the world?” Marlowe inquires, with more than a hint of ominous foreshadowing. “I don’t know,” she says, cradling a cigarette in her porcelain fingers. “That’s why I’m here.” The cynical detective pumps her for more information about her lover, which she parries with cagey insouciance. “Did he have things to hide?” he asks. She answers with a classic noir staple—a question for a question: “Haven’t we all?” Against his better judgement, Marlowe agrees to the assignment from his secretive new client, Clare Cavendish. (“Do call me Cavendish, without the missus.”) But it quickly becomes evident that it is the woman, and not the detective, who will pull all of the narrative strings. “You’re very perceptive and sensitive, Mr. Marlowe,” Cavendish says with a half-smile as she exits down a birdcage elevator. “I imagine it gives you trouble.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Kruger exudes a similar aura of mystery and sophistication on the (very) small screen, as I discover when we chat via Zoom a few weeks before Marlowe’s theatrical release. At first glance, the German ballerina-turned-model-turned-global actress bears the kind of self-possessed poise and athletic elegance that is indicative of a life spent in extensive physical and creative training. Yet it’s an interest in what lies beneath the glossy facade that has most characterized Kruger’s career." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“I tend to gravitate towards women who have a certain mystery to them,” she says of her femme fatale role in Marlowe. “Those who keep their cards close to their chests and who aren’t what you think they are at a first sight.” Examples of such characters in her filmography are extensive and varied: from Helen of Sparta and Marie Antoinette to Marlene Dietrich, in an upcoming project. While Kruger insists on the essential link between modern womanhood and speaking out (she has, herself, been vocal on issues like motherhood, gun-control, and the global refugee crisis), she admits that she’s intrigued by female protagonists—or antagonists—who maintain a certain taciturn ambiguity, or “an air of mystery.” “They are kind of a little bit dangerous, because you don’t exactly know who they are or what they pretend to be,” she explains." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "In Marlowe, Cavendish’s strategic role as eye candy or a caged bird in the detective-protagonist’s diegetic (and moral) quest for answers is flipped on its head precisely because of the character’s resistance to any predetermined sexual politics. She double-crosses both men and women (including her domineering mother, played by Jessica Lange), dresses in demure frocks and men’s slacks, uses her sexuality but never her sex. She is also an Irish parvenu, but sits at the center of Hollywood wealth and privilege. This knotty conflict between the eroticized and empowered femme fatale is at the core of the film, as it is in the entire film noir tradition. Like the classic vamps before her, from Barbara Stanwyck’s Phyllis Dietrichson to Ann Savage’s Vera and Marlene Dietrich’s Concha Pérez, Kruger’s Clare Cavendish is a feminist character avant la lettre. Kruger agrees. “In a way [the film] is really feminist, because you realize that the women are the ones who are the most intelligent.” " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "We turn to talking about her childhood in Algermissen, a village outside of Hanover, in what was then the Federal Republic of Germany; and she points out that her grandmother was her first source for seeing movie ingenues and femmes fatales like Dietrich, Hildegard Knef, and Romy Schneider. “[My grandmother] loved Marlene Dietrich and Magda Schneider—who was Romy Schneider’s mother—in the Heimatfilme,” she says. “I remember watching all of Marlene Dietrich’s films by the time I was 10.” She also recalls her grandfather’s anger at seeing Dietrich on television—the actress had been perceived by an entire generation of Germans as a traitor to the country for leaving it during the war. Although Kruger did not know it at the time, expatriates like Dietrich and Romy Schneider would blaze a trail for her to follow in her own career." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "In addition to exposing these cinematic icons to her, Kruger says that her grandmother inhabited the figure of a femme fatale in her own rite. As evidence, she recalls following her grandmother on regular walks around the village, when the latter would surreptitiously smoke her cigarettes away from the disapproving eyes of Kruger’s grandfather. When, years later, Kruger lit a cigarette in front of her grandmother, her reaction was fierce: “A lady doesn’t smoke in public,” she chided. " +

    title: "The Layered Intimacies of Nicole Eisenman’s Prints",
    author: "By Grace Edquist",
    content:
      "In 2010, on the heels of an intense period of painting, the artist Nicole Eisenman wanted a change, something to shake up a practice that had become almost too familiar. She packed her paints into a trunk, washed the walls of her studio in a fresh coat of white, and got to the formidable work of starting from scratch—this time as a printmaker. Two decades into a fruitful art career, she was a beginner again. “It felt really freeing: suddenly a whole new set of problems and puzzles to play with,” Eisenman says. For months on end she dedicated herself to learning the craft. She didn’t paint for a year. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The results of that intense burst of printmaking—and her work in the medium since—are now on glorious display at Print Center New York. “Nicole Eisenman: Prince,” running through May 13, includes more than 40 lithographs, etchings, monoprints, woodcuts, and other prints, some of which have rarely (if ever) been seen. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Eisenman’s body of work has positioned her as one of the most important artists working today and earned her a MacArthur award. For those familiar with Eisenman’s paintings and sculptures—which feature large and cartoon-like figures in situations that run from playful to almost sinister, often with queer and political themes—these prints are kindred spirits. Tonally, they are Nicole Eisenman all over. As in her other pieces, we see lots of people: alone, in groups, kissing, having a drink, hanging out. But there’s something different about these prints. They feel stripped down, peeled back, and intimate. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Where her oil paintings are bold and overt with vibrant colors and detailed narratives, many of the prints are subdued without much in the way of background detail. Still, what the New York–based Eisenman, 57, is able to communicate with the scrape of a knife’s edge astounds. In Untitled (Girl With a Tear), a woodcut from 2012, a sparsely carved and Picasso-like face uses but pink lines and negative space to convey a pain recognizable to just about anyone. There’s a whole ocean of feeling in that one languid teardrop. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Crucial to Eisenman’s printmaking, and highlighted in “Prince,” is her close collaboration with New York print shops Jungle Press, 10 Grand Press, and Harlan & Weaver. In her year of learning the art form, Eisenman created a weekly schedule for herself, studiously rotating among the three shops as she worked with their expert printers on various techniques. “I got really hungry to learn about all these different processes,” Eisenman says. Immersion was the point. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "And there was a lot to learn. Printmaking can get very technical, and Eisenman’s constant experimentation meant pushing the bounds of what was possible in terms of materials, process, scale, color, and so on. (Bathtub Relief, to your left as you enter the Print Center gallery space, is a brand-new sculptural piece made from Aqua-Resin and fiberglass that requires a “Do not touch” sign—not often expected at a print show.) This spirit of ongoing exploration and risk-taking may be inherited from her father. “He was a psychiatrist, but he always had a hobby,” Eisenman recalls. “One year it was a woodshop in the basement, another year he got into stained glass windows, and he was an amateur poet. I think I got this gift of restlessness and curiosity from him.” " +

    title: "A new Lord of the Rings film reboot is on the way",
    author: "By Lucy Ford",
    content:
      "The complicated world of The Lord of the Rings rights is almost as confusing as the topography of Middle-earth. With Amazon securing TV rights for J.R.R Tolkien's work, whether there will be more films coming our way from a different studio has been in contention for a while. Now, it looks like that issue has been settled with Warner Brothers announcing more movies based on Lord of the Rings are coming. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The new Tolkien works will come as a partnership with New Line Cinema, who distributed Peter Jackson's original Lord of the Rings trilogy between 2001-2003. The teams also then worked together for the release of The Hobbit franchise. With Rings of Power already scratching the Middle-earth itch on our small screens, here's everything we know about the world's next big screen adventures. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "What will the films be about? " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Most people's first on-screen introduction to The Lord of the Rings came with Peter Jackson's original trilogy adaptation (although there was a 1978 animated film which is better left unspoken about). From then we had its prequel, The Hobbit, which kept us firmly in the Third Age of Middle-earth but just slightly before the adventures of Frodo and the Fellowship. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "When Rings of Power eventually made it to our screen in 2022 in a five-year deal with Amazon, it chose to focus thousands of years prior to Tolkien's original work in Middle-earth's Second Age, giving us our fix of the universe without really touching any of the original series." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Now, it seems like we'll be heading back to the third age again. Not much is known exactly about what stories these new films with Warner Bros. will tell, but they've already been in touch with Peter Jackson. In a statement, Jackson said “we look forward to speaking with them further to hear their vision for the franchise moving forward”, suggesting whatever films come our way might follow a world post-Frodo dumping the one ring in Mount Doom. However, the films could also move laterally, instead focusing more on characters we got to know from the original trilogy. " +

      "In Her New Show, Indigenous Artist Rose B. Simpson Paves Her Own Path",
    author: "By Christian Allaire",
    content:
      "Indigenous artist Rose B. Simpson has grown up around clay her entire life. Raised on the Santa Clara Pueblo reservation in New Mexico, Simpson was exposed to the material from a young age: Her mother, Roxanne Swentzell, is an acclaimed ceramics artist herself, as are many of Simpson’s aunts, uncles, and grandparents. (Simpson says her family has been working with clay for over 70 generations.) “My mom would give me a little chunk of clay just to get me to go away,” Simpson laughs. “I remember squishing it into a little square and then eating it. I’ve been playing with clay my whole life.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The artist soon began creating her own artworks with clay. She learned how to mold forms or fire kilns by watching her family members and quickly learned that the Pueblo approach to pottery is one of a kind. (Simpson is an enrolled member of the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe.) “We started experimenting with glazing when nobody was doing that,” Simpson says. “We don’t play by the rules. We’re always looking for new ways to express ourselves.” This contemporary approach to such a traditional craft has been a strong point in Simpson’s recent works: She enjoys adding unexpected details, such as glazes inspired by tattoos or graffiti lines, onto her tall, commanding figures. “I realized [during college] that I can make this something that I care about—I didn’t have to do what my family did,” Simpson says. “It can represent youth culture and experiences that are personal to me. I don’t have to perpetuate stereotypes.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Simpson’s distinctive approach is certainly on full view in her new showcase. Today, the artist presents her first solo exhibition in New York City, titled Road Less Traveled, at the Jack Shainman Gallery. (It runs through April 8.) The inspiration for the new body of work stems from the idea of creating her own pathways—challenging herself to work with clay in a manner that feels totally unique to her. She first thought of the concept in 2020, when she began looking back on her work. “I started looking at what the road less traveled is for myself and how can I honor that,” Simpson says. “I began challenging myself and asking, ‘Is there another way to make this?’ You have to resist the urge to make it easy: It’s so easy to put a feather or a drum on something and sell it. But through my work, I pushed myself to do the harder thing.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Every work in the new exhibition reflects this spirit. Simpson makes an intentional (and successful) attempt at differentiating her work from her family’s long lineage of artists. She does so by allowing herself to explore her most wild or experimental concepts through clay. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The first piece she made for the show, for instance, is titled Guides and is made of clay, steel, and grout. It is a figure with three extra heads floating on top and is inspired by the “mysterious figures” who have been guiding Simpson throughout her life. “In the [past] few years, I’ve had this very clear awareness of having guides on multidimensional planes that are helping me out,” she says. “The more that I’m aware they’re there, the more that I can remember to ask them for direction.” " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Her work Conjure II features a head made of clay, grout, and New Mexico pine; floating rings hover just above it, representing a cloud of intention. The piece represents Simpson’s relationship with faith. “I believe really deeply in prayer,” she says. “I think about Conjure II as remembering how to visualize our clear needs and wants and how to believe in manifestation.” " +

      "At Princeton, a New Exhibition Unpacks Toni Morrison’s Complex Creative Process ",
    author: "By André-Naquian Wheeler",
    content:
      "More often than not, readers only encounter a text in its most polished form, when the action flows seamlessly and characters seem to leap off the page. But a new exhibition dedicated to the work of Pulitzer Prize–winning novelist Toni Morrison (1931–2019) reveals what many writers would rather keep hidden: just how tough and unnatural writing a book can feel. At Princeton University’s Firestone Library, “Toni Morrison: Sites of Memory” paints a mesmerizing portrait of an author who worked whenever and wherever, gathering her Post-it notes and day planners covered in snippets of dialogue, carefully drawn-out genealogies for the characters in Beloved, and a feature-length Tar Baby screenplay (from before Morrison’s decision to tell the enduring story as a novel), among other treasures. Until now, all of these things “only existed as the invisible infrastructure of [Morrison’s] work,” says Autumn Womack, an assistant professor of English and African American studies at Princeton." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Womack began curating “Sites of Memory” in the summer of 2020. “Somewhere along the way, we realized we were on our own archaeological dig,” she tells me during a tour of the exhibition. “We worked to reconstruct parts of Toni Morrison’s creative process and worked to prioritize the labor, the study, and the rigor that is at the heart of the work itself.”  " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "There was a lot to comb through. Princeton University Library owns the Toni Morrison Papers, which includes nearly 400 boxes of materials saved and collected by the Nobel laureate over her lifetime. There are letters from Nina Simone, exchanges with editors about the strengths and weaknesses of a draft, yellow legal pads covered in text. “It seems to me that she was someone who kept everything,” Womack observes. “She saved every single draft. [That] was really part of her process.” Princeton makes a fitting steward of Morrison’s legacy: She taught there for 17 years, and in 2017 the university dedicated Morrison Hall—currently home to the African American studies department—in her honor. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The exhibition is divided into six nonlinear sections (a nod to Morrison’s penchant for winding plot structures), titled “Beginnings,” “Writing Time,” “Thereness-ness,” “Wonderings and Wanderings,” “Genealogies of Black Feminism,” and “Speculative Futures.” “Beginnings” shows proof of a burgeoning writer with grand yet precise ambitions. Take, for example, a first-edition copy of Morrison’s debut novel, The Bluest Eye (1971), for which she made the bold decision to forgo an illustration or picture on the cover and instead print the memorable first paragraph of the book there. “Quiet as it’s kept, there were no marigolds in the fall of 1941,” the browned cover on display reads. “We thought, at the time, it was because Pecola was having her father’s baby that the marigolds did not grow.”  " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Elsewhere, a black-and-white photo on loan from Howard University captures Morrison the actor, donning dramatic Elizabethan garb for a role in Shakespeare’s King Lear. (Morrison was a member of the Howard Players at the prestigious HBCU from 1949–1953.) “What this section unfurls is different and more diverse aspects of Morrison’s life,” Womack explains. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Walking from section to section, one also notices some papers are singed at the edges, with streaks of ash sometimes obfuscating portions of text. This is because a fire on Christmas Day 1993 gutted the Hudson Valley house where Morrison lived with her two sons and stored papers in the basement. “All the research materials and drafts for Song of Solomon, her third novel, were thought to have been destroyed,” Womack shares. “In the course of our curatorial research, we uncovered the only surviving drafts of Song of Solomon in these day planners.”  " +

    author: "By Anna Wintour",
    content:
      "Editor’s Note: After two decades at the pinnacle of men’s tennis, Roger Federer has announced his retirement from the sport—bidding a warm and emotional farewell on social media. “I have played more than 1500 matches over 24 years,” he writes. “Tennis has treated me more generously than I ever would have dreamt, and now I must recognize when it is time to end my competitive career.” His last professional match will be next weekend in London at the Laver Cup, the five-year-old team tennis competition between Europe and the U.S. that Federer helped create. In a must-see swan song, he’ll (hopefully) play doubles again with his longtime rival and friend Rafael Nadal on Friday night. Vogue’s global editorial director, Anna Wintour, who has been friends with Federer for years, pays tribute to an extraordinary champion." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "In public life, as in tennis, losses come in clusters. Like most people with connections to the United Kingdom, I have spent the past days feeling the loss of Queen Elizabeth II, who reigned for as long as I can remember. I spent much of this summer mourning the loss from the court of a queen in another sense, Serena Williams: an athlete who, along with her sister, Venus, broke barriers, raised standards, and enlarged not just the soul of women’s tennis but its heart." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "When my friend and hero Roger Federer told me that he, too, was retiring from professional tennis, my own heart skipped a beat. There was the sadness of knowing that I wouldn’t again have the thrill of turning on the television—or rushing to London, to Paris, to Melbourne, to all the places I’ve watched Roger play—and see him do the impossible. But there was also a deep gratitude for all that he gave us, on the court and off, over so many years. There is not a player who deserves retirement more, or whose absence on the court we will feel more acutely." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Like many people, I first became aware of Roger when he was a long-haired youth making waves in Houston at the 2003 Tennis Masters Cup. You could tell he was special. There was that incredible speed. There was the unreal work close to the net. And there was the way he made it all look devastatingly easy. But there was also, just as importantly, a kindness and a grace—one might even say a dignity—in the way he carried himself on the court and off. Federer fans, one finds, are different from the usual sports fans. They don’t just swarm to him; they rise to him, and I think his sense of decency has lots to do with that. But, then, I speak with a bias of my own, I suppose: By this point, I had become an avid Federer fan myself." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "It wasn’t long before I managed to meet Roger. He was interested in fashion and eager to talk about it. There was nothing I wanted to talk about less with Roger Federer than fashion. I wanted to talk tennis. We never stopped conversing at cross-purposes this way, him asking me about designers and me brushing off the questions to ask about what he did on the court. But at some point we realized that—even if we never did get the information we wanted—we liked each other enormously. I helped him with some looks, and he did his valiant best to help me with my game." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "One of the most extraordinary gifts I’ve ever received came from my daughter, Bee, and her husband, Francesco: They gave me the gift of Roger on my home court. We were out in the country, when all of a sudden there was some sort of commotion near the tennis court. I was looking for someone to ask what was going on, and, amid the hubbub, I spied a familiar face. How funny! I thought. That looks uncannily like Roger. It was, of course—I was the last to know. He spent that day playing with my entire family. I’ve led a life filled with luck and interesting people, but I’ve rarely had such a sense of a dream coming true. What really struck me, though, was that I knew that this kindness—coming out to the middle of nowhere just to play with us amateurs—wasn’t out of character. Roger has a marvelous foundation, which serves African children in poverty, but he is generous even in his daily life. He gives to the extent he has received." +

      "Among the more notable wine trends in the last few years is the resurrection of fortified wines by a younger generation of drinkers. A pour of sherry no longer evokes that stuffy Old World sentiment, and bartenders are making good use of its versatility in cocktail programs (it crosses both styles of dry and sweet). “Without question, the Sherry regions of Jerez de la Frontera, Sanlúcar de Barrameda, and El Puerto de Santa Maria are worth traveling to,” Golden Age Hospitality beverage director Ashley Santoro says. “Historically, sherry has had a reputation for being extremely sweet and consumed by an older generation. In general, I think that consumers are becoming more educated and adventurous, allowing for more elevated imbibing experiences.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Jerez has a hot, sunny Mediterranean climate, while the other two destinations are smaller seaside towns. “The terroir is extremely unique and dominated by Albariza, a limestone-rich soil that’s almost brilliant white in color,” Santoro says. Maturation is also a linchpin in the sherry production process, and will be a highlight in any winery visit. “My top tasting picks when visiting the region are Emilio Hidalgo, El Maestro Sierra, and Valdespino,” she adds. “And because the production process is quite extensive (and fascinating), the tours tend to be lengthy and comprehensive, so plan ahead.”" +

    title: "An ode to the emo genre and how it will never be the same again",
    author: "By Azrin Ta",
    content:
      "Sometime earlier this year, an entire generation that once was, stirred in their wake; all reacting to news they always secretly hoped for, but had felt, for the longest time, like it could only ever be a faraway dream. The big news? All their favourite bands were coming back in full swing—gathering on a single stage for a smashing musical line-up at the When We Were Young Festival, almost reminiscent of the once-upon-a-time Warped Tour. And with the likes of throwback favourites such as the since-reunited My Chemical Romance, Paramore, A Day to Remember, Mayday Parade and Jimmy Eat World—all the bands that influenced the music of the 2000s—set to play the stage, the buzz amassed was unequivocally an understandable one. And so the tickets were instantly swept up, hailing fans of the once emo punk genre from all over the globe. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Whilst we could dive into an entire spiel on how the emo scene dominated the alternative cultural climate of the ‘00s, there’s a whole other conversation occurring elsewhere about how recent years have seen a ‘pop punk revival’ in various forms. On one hand, we’ve seen Machine Gun Kelly push out a number of notable collaborations with emo behemoths such as Bring Me The Horizon and Avril Lavigne herself. On the soloist front, Olivia Rodrigo and Maggie Lindemann’s recent studio albums carry with them the signifying traits of adolescent angst riding on moody, raw lines and high, crashing choruses—poised like a devil-may-care salutation from the teenager’s hellhole itself. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "And somehow even with genre stalwarts like Lavigne giving their stamp of approval in this strange, almost pandemic-induced resurgence, there’s a large part of the in-crowd that can’t quite wrap their heads around this supposed sentiment. And you know what? We can’t blame them. After all, for many of the festival go-ers and excitable fans of the When We Were Young line-up, the driving force behind their swelling paranoia, is nothing else but that damned nostalgia. It’s the longing for the music that gave the youth of the ‘00s a rebellious voice; loud, confessional and filled with tumultuous energy. And recalling a whole mood of its own for the estranged, lonely teenager that once had been. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Critics of the emo wave might add that many of the bands classified under this same emo genre were never ever actually pushing out the same sort of music—a useful pretext to the way many of these bands had resisted being pigeonholed in the first place. And they stand to reason; Panic! At The Disco’s Pretty Odd album in 2008 was an exuberant twist of ‘60s style pop, sitting miles apart from Dashboard Confessional’s slowly intoxicating ‘Stolen’. Gerard Way himself had long been attempting to detangle My Chemical Romance from this loose umbrella term the band had come to be constantly associated with. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "But sans the somewhat other derogatory connotations that also came with being labelled as ‘emo’, it’s still worth considering what the scene had already evolved into by this time. There’s probably a whole song to be sung about everything else that came packaged with the subculture it took on; perhaps you were once a tumblr girl, or your sartorial cues came in the form of Lavigne’s signature rock band tees, skinny ties and chunky lace-up boots. Maybe you even attempted to dip-dye your hair pink at some point in your teenage years and blasted Paramore’s Riot album so loud in your room as if you were set to mosh at the Warped Tour the very next week. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "And you know what? Those were all inseparable parts of the wayward mood that ruled the zeitgeist—which sang a you-had-to-be-there sort of tune. What matters then, is that you shared a part of it all. Because it gave you a place to be—when you had nowhere else to go." +
      "<br />" +

    title: "All the best Korean R&B collaborative tracks to press play on",
    author: "By Nicole Kliest",
    content:
      "It was a joint move no one had seen coming. We recall the month of April 2018: when a momentous collaboration blossomed on-screen in the K-music scene. Household names Hwasa and Loco made an enchanting pair as they took to the studio mics for ‘Don’t’—a collaborative track produced by Woogie on music reality television show ‘The Hyena on The Keyboard’. And so what started off as a cold call from Hwasa to the affable rapper, Loco, was turned into pure musical gold: an R&B track that merges the singer’s smooth, whispery sound with Loco’s clean delivery of his rap lines. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "For the uninitiated, the Mamamoo vocalist and rapper, Hwasa, has long established herself as a bold force within the K-pop realm, known for her infectious confidence, alternative lyrics and aloof stage presence that strays away from the hyper-feminine image of a typical girl group member in South Korea. In some sense, her fluid and versatile musical style perhaps set the perfect playing field for the combination with Loco, known for his playful and laidback flow. Whilst the track went on to top South Korea’s music charts globally as fans were floored by the unexpected chemistry they displayed lyrically, as well as in the accompanying music video, their collaborative moment was also a defining one: opening up more doors for fellow industry players who dabbled in a similar musical style to swivel into the mainstream as the sound became a more coveted affair on the whole. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Fast forward to today: Hwasa and Loco have surprised us all by joining hands again—marking their second collaborative move with not just one track, but two. Titled ‘Somebody’ and ‘Lemon’, the duet shows off their epic chemistry and harmonious sync-up in both tracks—one, an uplifting song of sweet love and the other, a more subdued track that likens life to the bittersweet nature of lemons. Along with the double release, fans have also been rewarded with an accompanying music video for the titular track, where they playfully flirt and turn on their on-screen charms." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "In celebration of their unprecedented return together, we chronicle a noteworthy series of other collaborative tracks in the Korean R&B realm, where other sweet voices of the K-pop scene—think IU, Lee Hi and Chung Ha—make their wondrous entrance into the alternative sound. As you tune into Hwasa and Loco’s latest tracks, don’t forget to add these picks to your playlist, all for your perusal below." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "In the world of K-rap and hip-hop, Code Kunst’s name as a producer and composer is instantly recognisable—for his work with genre headliners such as Hyukoh, G.Soul and BewhY. Yet some of his most memorable moments include his collaborations with soul singer Lee Hi. ‘O’ stands as one of sixteen tracks in his People album, taking a more upbeat approach to the melancholic narrative offered in their previous tracks together: ‘X’ and ‘XI’.  " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "A soothing anthem for those cold, lonely nights; ‘Rain Song (feat. Colde) combines Epik High’s lyrical flow with Colde’s melodic voice that sadly reminisces the memories of a past lover as the raindrops fall outside—capturing the moment perfectly with their heart-rending lyrics. " +

      "When it comes to interior design, 2022 has been the year of curved lines. “Looking back, this year was very much about arches, curved walls and soft curved furniture. Mineral plaster was also popular. These trends create a very soothing, almost resort-like feeling in the home,” shares Naoko Takenouchi, co-founder of integrated design firm Takenouchi Webb" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The pandemic-ridden last few years, she believes, have definitely impacted the way we choose to design our spaces. “With people being unable to travel during the pandemic, and work and living spaces merging together, people wanted to make space for relaxation. The trends in 2022 naturally mirror that,” she explains." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "As for how interior design trends will evolve in 2023, Takenouchi chooses not to pinpoint specific colours or aesthetics. Instead, she takes a different approach—examining how our wants and needs have shifted over the course of the past few years. What we require from our living spaces, in the same vein, will shift too." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The amount of time we have spent at home in recent years, she believes, will lead to greater incorporation of personal hobbies into our living spaces, as well as an openness to eclecticism when it comes to designing a home. A growing spotlight on sustainability may also have a part to play in the choice of furniture and decor we pick." +

      "We were both engaged (you for real and I in effect) by the time we met. We agreed we respected our respective partners too much to act on the unnameable thing that no doubt existed between us. We agreed it would be best to never meet in person ever again, but that we would find a way to keep in touch by other means. We ruled out phone calls. We ruled out texting. We ruled out emailing. We settled on snail-mail." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "We exchanged a couple of letters before we realized that anything involving words at all was far too dangerous. I am good with words and so are you. I travel an inordinate amount for work and so do you. I was in London brewing myself a cup of 1837 Black Tea. It carried a lingering aftertaste of anise and caramel. The teabag told me these fruits and flowers were sourced from the Bermuda Triangle. I thought of how we would never go there—or anywhere else for that matter—and decided the next best thing would be to mail you a fresh teabag alongside my used teabag in a hotel envelope, without a sender’s name, without a return address." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Four years later we have not spoken a word. But I have drunk the world in tea with you. You’ve sent me New York Breakfast Tea, I’ve sent you Weekend in Dubai Tea. You’ve sent me Moroccan Mint Tea, I’ve sent you Place Vendôme Tea. Partaking in these notes and flavours we have crossed continents and tasted terroir without packing a suitcase or boarding a plane. When I sip the Grand Darjeeling you’ve sent, I see undulating foothills of tea bushes wrapped in mist, silver tips thick with the scent of wildflowers and cracked hazelnut. Tea is more than a moment; it is alchemy." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Last week you sent me Silver Moon Tea. Today I wake early so I’ll have the kitchen completely to myself. I set the kettle to boil. I place both the fresh and used teabags into the teapot, fill it with scalding hot water. As I let them steep, I wonder what you do with the teabags I send you. Do you brew them together, like me? Discard the one I’ve used, brew just the fresh one? Hide them away in a drawer, or toss them out? The tea is done now. I pour myself a cup, inhale the bouquet: crystalline green tea laced with ripe berry and a touch of vanilla. Suave, with just a lick of spice, and a sweetness so subtle. I drink you in." +

      "It has been some time since departing from our bustling island-state has been easy to do. Travel‘s gradual resumption might feel almost too good to be true, but there is no time like the present for a getaway to Bali. It’s an idyllic location for a weekend escape—its sunny beaches and clear waters the perfect antidote to our skyscraper-filled city. And if you’re in the mood to turn up, look to hospitality insider and restaurateur Rushi Krishna’s selection of the best nightlife spots and kickbacks in Bali." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Having lived in Bali for four years, Krishna has just opened her own venture on the island: an Indian restaurant named Krishna’s Kitchen. To her, Bali’s biggest charm lies in its lush nature-scape, but its thriving nightlife comes in as a close second. With people from all across the globe flocking to the island to unwind and let loose, there is never a shortage of a lavish party." +

      "Now, Krishna lives in Uluwatu—which is a much sleepier town than the nearby Canggu—but she still loves a good after-work tipple. “To me, partying is about good friends, good music and good drinks. I am a true believer that a party can happen anywhere as long as the vibe is right,” she comments. As a seasoned hospitality professional, Krishna’s standards for service are exacting, so you can be sure that her recommendations include only the best of the best. Here, find her favourite bars to visit around the island, alongside a special supper spot handpicked by Vogue. " +

That's stayed with us so generally I've never been more focused on my health. I make sure I’m not putting anything particularly bad into my body, I stay away from medicines and only use something that's organic or homeopathic. I also have found that rather than trying to fix a problem once you've got an illness or something, it’s better to try to preempt it by being as healthy as possible. For me, I'm just always looking at how I can gain an advantage. How can I be healthier? How can I have more energy?" +

      "The Standard, Bangkok Mahanakhon is the latest hotel to see and be seen",
    author: "By Amelia Chia",
    content:
      "People-watching at The Standard, Bangkok Mahanakhon, is a satisfying pastime. The brand’s flagship property in Asia attracts a certain crowd to it—young creatives and well-heeled style stalwarts in Nike Dunks or oversized Balenciaga T-shirts run amok, sipping on a cocktail or coffee in one of the hotel’s six dining spots. Many pairs of sunglasses are sported indoors, and the elevators’ generous full-length mirrors are the perfect set-up for your next TikTok or BeReal content. I, like everyone else around me, was drawn to The Standard’s vibrant spaces like a moth to flame, as we languidly flit through the hotel in what feels like a modern-day Wes Anderson film." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The lobby at The Standard, Bangkok Mahanakhon—likely the first place you’ll head to when you arrive—is a stunning room with a love for curves. Sofas arch beautifully against the walls, while plush armchairs are positioned invitingly across from it. The stellar design team at The Standard and Jaime Hayon and Hayon Studios are behind the design brilliance of The Standard, Bangkok Mahanakhon, with a tight curation of colours and objects which lend to its panache. Castleton green and rosewood shades fill the space alongside leafy foliage from the hotel’s potted plants. Its shelves act as a gallery of sorts, with artful, whimsical objects made by Thai artisans on display. Indie-pop tunes waft gently through the space, with a playlist mostly dedicated on local artists." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Once you’re done marvelling at your surroundings, the friendly guest experience team takes over and guides you to your room, accompanied by lively chatter about the things you can do in the vicinity. The hotel’s 155 rooms and suites are an extension of your fanciful home away from home, with every luxury amenity you will need. While children are not frequent sightings in the hotel, the staff do a great job in catering to them—expect little trinkets and homemade snacks, and a cot in your room should you require one." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "As an entry point, the Standard and Deluxe rooms are a decent 40 to 45 square metres, dressed in neutral tones with pops of rust on the bed, and also features a dusty pink bathroom and rain shower. However, if space is what you’re after, book the Suite Spot, a cavernous 83 square-metre suite with floor-to-ceiling window views in both the living area and bedroom, reminiscent of the rooms at The Standard, High Line in New York. Bright and airy, with accents of canary yellow and cobalt blue, the suite is ideal for families, or those who prefer a more spacious stay. I took a long time to find the bathroom—it caught me by surprise, actually—as it is hidden through a discreet entrance in the bedroom, where a giant soaking tub awaits (big enough for two, three or your entire brood)." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Located in the Ole Scheeren-designed Mahanakhon Tower, ducking out of the hotel for a Michelin-starred meal or the city’s famed crab omelette is an easy ride away, but staying in for your meals and avoiding Bangkok’s notorious traffic is a wondrous option, too. Food at The Standard, Bangkok Mahanakhon, is impressive both for quality and variety—your cravings will be kept to a minimum." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Be sure to make a reservation at The Standard Grill, a spirited American brasserie similar to the one in New York. Start with the Tiger Prawn Cocktail, served with iceberg lettuce and country bread, for something traditionally old-school American, followed by the moreish Roasted Jerusalem Artichoke Soup, topped with toasted almonds and brown butter. The Jack’s Creek Black Angus Grain Fed Tenderloin was superbly tender with every bite, worthy of every top steakhouse worldwide. Paired with a sumptuous Potato Millefeuille and Creamed English Spinach, you’ll be wonderfully content when you’re done—possibly also forgetting you’re in Bangkok, not New York." +

Head to a large furniture store on a Saturday afternoon and yes you'll be able to test out the best sofas and get a real sense of the fabric and quality of the design, but you'll also be limited to only a small number of options.

And while, yes, you can't try each piece before you buy, most online furniture stores have comprehensive trial periods, meaning you'll often be able to test your sofa or mattress out for a bit before committing for good.

      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Their highly dedicated fandom—known as ‘BLINK’—can tell you almost everything you need to know about Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. Within the multitudes of fan content, from Tumblr sites to YouTube channels, there already exists a well-documented timeline of their stratospheric rise to success since debuting with their single album Square One in 2016. Yet, there is much we don’t know about the group, something director Caroline Suh has endeavoured to uncover through an intimate portrait into the lives of these four young women." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Over 79 minutes, Suh creates a compelling watch for both newcomers to the band as well as those who have closely followed both Blackpink and the K-pop industry. Each member is given room to reflect on their success and their lives, allowing a glimpse into how they’ve become the world’s biggest girl band (work, work and more work) and insight into why Blackpink are idolised by millions of people around the world, including Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, Louis Vuitton’s Nicolas Ghesquière and Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri. The film is surprisingly candid in places, particularly as they reveal just how tough their years of training were mentally, physically and emotionally." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Featuring archive footage and unfiltered moments between the band, this is everything we learned (and loved) about Light Up The Sky." +

      "<br />" +
      "Being powerful is a multifaceted state" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Blackpink have redefined the idea of what a powerful girl band looks and sounds like, particularly offstage—they’re determined and competitive, but they’re also sensitive and supportive. Their relationship has been built on generosity, whether it’s through helping each other overcome language barriers or sharing skills." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "As with all K-pop proteges, they trained for 14 hours a day, were graded monthly and criticised heavily— the difficult conditions triggered Blackpink’s fighting spirit. For Rosé, the thought of leaving without accomplishing anything was an “embarrassment”, while Jennie’s steely side emerged like armour: “The tougher they treated me, I was like, I’m going to get through it and I’m going to show them that I’m worth it.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "To train as an idol in K-pop, you’re up against dozens of equally hungry trainees, and having innate talent doesn’t automatically mean you’re going to make it. The temptation to step on others to get to the top is always there, but for Blackpink, there was no jostling for centre position. “Everyone has their place and their role,” says Jisoo, and when that’s accepted and understood, “that’s when synergy is born.”" +

Some of these people went on a downward spiral and had high levels of anxiety, while others facing the exact same circumstances didn’t have poor mental health." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "If we look at crises and global catastrophes, there are people who face the harsh reality using a calm, determined mindset, while others are struggling to cope and sink. What is the difference between these two groups? The difference is the strategies they use to deal with stress; how you swim when you’re thrown into the deep end. But there are science-based ways of taking charge of our mental health and turning things around — and we can learn these and use them to our advantage." +

      "<br />" +
      "Regain control in your life " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The first thing is to let go of the things you cannot control and only focus on the things that you can. Often, we’re frustrated because we can’t control the outcome of something, such as getting that job or receiving that text message from the person we’ve been craving to hear from. It’s this state of not knowing that can push us into mental illness territory. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "You might start performing rituals to alleviate your anxiety, such as only taking 10 sips of water each time you have a drink or repeatedly opening and closing the door to your bedroom — otherwise whatever you wish for won’t come true. This is the response of a highly anxious mind that’s trying to be proactive in the face of uncertainty. Or you might become superstitious and start thinking, “If I tell others how happy I am that my boss wants to take my ideas forward, this won’t materialise anymore.” If we start to succumb to this and become a slave to our superstitious thoughts, this can be fertile ground for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

    author: "By Sarah Raphael and Naomi Shimada",
    content:
      "As Instagram continues to trial invisible ‘likes’ across select countries such as Australia, Japan, Ireland and Brazil, digital companies are scrutinising the negative effects of online behaviour on mental health and self-esteem more closely than ever—and rightly so. Since the ‘like’ button was first introduced by Vimeo in 2005, with Facebook propelling it into common usage in 2009, reports show that children are now linking self-worth to the number of ‘likes’ a social-media post gets. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "There is still a way to go for Twitter, Facebook and other social media platforms in terms of publicly addressing their responsibilities towards their users’ emotional wellbeing, which is why writer and editor Sarah Raphael and model, writer and campaigner Naomi Shimada have taken the issue into their own hands. In September, the pair published Mixed Feelings: Exploring the Emotional Impact of our Digital Habits, a collection of personal essays and honest conversations about how the internet is really making women feel, penned by international digital experts, creatives, activists and NHS doctors who all have one thing in common when it comes to social media: they love it, they hate it, they can’t get off it. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Ahead of World Mental Health Day (10 October), Raphael and Shimada share five ways to break out of the digital bubble and rewire some unhelpful online habits, without turning your back on social media completely. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "1. Judge, and be judged " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "When Instagram began in 2010, the platform was used to post still-life photographs of art, food and scenic holidays that followers would simply ‘like’, or not. Nine years on, it has evolved to become a personal branding platform—now it’s people’s faces, bodies, political opinions and professional achievements that are deemed likeable or not. The birth of influencer culture in 2014 intensified this act of judgment by establishing a hierarchy between the insta-famous and the insta-layman. How many times have we internally labelled someone as vain or privileged based on the online content they post?" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "As philosopher Eckhart Tolle said in Oprah’s SuperSoul Conversations podcast: “What we most strongly condemn in others is usually something we also have—a trait that we are unconscious of in ourselves.” Tolle says that every time we feel either superior or inferior, it’s our ego. Take a moment to self-reflect and think about what’s driving your reactions as you scroll." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "2. You don’t actually look like that" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "According to research by plastic surgeons, a photograph taken at arm’s length can make your nose look up to 29 per cent bigger. Meanwhile, photo-editing tools such as Facetune, Apple’s most popular paid app in 2017, offer users the opportunity to narrow their nose. Your selfies—and others that you might be comparing yourself to—are about as representative as a distorted mirror." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Consider how the act of taking a selfie actually makes you feel. If it feels like a positive tool to document your experience and express yourself, then continue. If, however, selfies exacerbate your anxieties or incite new ones, remember: you don’t have to take them. Taking selfies has become almost instinctual for the digital generation—the average millennial will take 25,000 in their lifetime—but it’s not too late to rewire that instinct. You might find that your self-confidence improves when you stop scrutinising yourself on your phone." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "3. Let’s travel consciously" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Instagram has transformed the way we travel, from finding tourist-free beaches to under-the-radar hotels. While this influx of tourism can have a positive impact on the economy and employment rates, it’s also led to overcrowding, environmental degradation and dangerous stunts, with several deaths by social-media selfie widely reported, showing the lengths people are prepared to go for that shot. “A lot of people are still very ego-driven; they want to portray that they’re living some kind of perfect life,” photographer Trey Ratcliff told National Geographic. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Travelling more mindfully is key. Stop to reflect on the ethics of the frame and how you’re portraying the place and the people in the shot. This can also help with staying present and lessening that pressure to compete with others online. Ask yourself: “If I couldn’t take a picture, would I still be here?”—if the answer is no, reconsider your trip." +

    title: "The power of breathwork on your mind, body and soul",
    author: "By Alli Sim",
    content:
      "When was the last time you did nothing but breathe? Phone down. Eyes closed. All your awareness directed to your breath. Notice your breath at this moment. Are you taking calm, deep breaths? Is the pace as short and clipped as your patience? Or are you holding your breath entirely, as if awaiting bad news? For an essential, life-sustaining act that should be second nature, human beings aren’t always the best at breathing. The average person takes between 17,000 and 23,000 breaths per day and it’s rare for many of us to consciously notice the breath, unless we’re faced with dis-ease. Cognitively, we know that the breath is vital for survival, but isn’t this really a case of not appreciating what we have till it’s gone? Cue breathwork." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“Everything in our body is governed by the breath—our bones, blood, tissue, organs and believe it or not, even our cells have a rhythm in which they breathe and operate within us,” shares craniosacral therapist and yoga practitioner, Kathy Gabriel. When under stress, our body’s sympathetic nervous system or ‘fight or flight’ response is activated. In this state of panic, anger or fear, the breath quickens and shallows. “Many of us actually under-breathe, meaning we use more of our secondary (sometimes called accessory) breathing muscles instead of our primary breathing muscles to breathe,” explains the breathwork teacher. These secondary breathing muscles are located around the neck and upper chest region, which accounts for improper and often shallow breathing, causing us to feel fatigue in these areas—not to mention cyclical stress, she says. Primary breathing muscles on the other hand “involve our respiratory diaphragm, muscles around the rib cage and abdomen, and pelvic floor”." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Sadly with the pace of life and our increasingly sedentary lifestyle, taking deep, belly breaths seems more like a yoga retreat-worthy indulgence. Poor breathing triggers a cascade of negative reactions in our body, including stress and anxiety on loop." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“The quality of your breath has real physiological outcomes. Over time, this can affect our immune system, mental well-being and emotional resilience to take on whatever life throws at us,” says Gabriel." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "The breath and our emotions" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), each organ is connected to an emotion. Curiously, “the lung is linked with grief and letting go”, says TCM physician, Jun Negoro of Mino Chinese Medical Clinic. She shares that shortness of breath and shallow breathing are all too common in patients under high stress or sufferers of chronic fatigue." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Negoro explains that long-term lung imbalances such as breathing issues may lead to “sadness and detachment” and vice-versa. A Yale study on the relationship between emotions and respiration found that significant emotional states are associated with different forms of breathing. Changing our breath therefore, can alter how we feel. In a content or relaxed state, our breath tends to be regular, slow and deep." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "“Studies have shown that deep steady breathing stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system (‘rest and digest’ mode) and tells our brain to calm down. This slows down the heart rate and signals to the body that we’re safe,” says Negoro. “Studies with mental health conditions are synonymous with shallow breathing or hyperventilation. As it is, our breath is directly related to our emotions,” says MR Jab, sports medicine trainer and Breathera breathwork facilitator at Movement and Sports Medicine Centre." +

    author: "By Yvette King",
    content:
      "It’s safe to say as a collective, we have experienced a global trauma in recent years. Being sequestered in our homes for months at a time, our physical ties to family and friends severed, potential financial distress and/or job loss and with anxiety levels surging with the uncertainty—all thanks to the pandemic, mental health matters were elucidated. And as silver linings would have it, also somewhat validated as they became more prevalent, as it were." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Google Trends reveals that in 2022, people in Singapore are searching the term “mental health” more than twice they were pre-Covid. For once, we were forced to pause and in the stillness, were confronted with self-reflection. As a therapist, speaker, writer and founder of Illuma Health, Singapore, Natalia Rachel’s cathartic book Why am I Like This? Illuminating the Traumatized Self couldn’t have come at a more opportune time, as we navigate a communal upheaval hangover and the recalibrations that have come with it. " +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "One of the keystones of Rachel’s findings from her own existential exploration is that through self-inquiry, self-compassion and embodiment practice, one can experience illumination. Once we are able to identify our trauma—that according to Rachel, if present, exists in our psyche, our soma and our spirit, we are able to start a palliate process. For her, self-help books might bring “awareness, moments of epiphany and concepts to mentally integrate” but actually “healing is about finding our way back to ourselves and each other” and that “for our existential experience to change, healing needs to occur in a social context. Healing is dynamic.” Through her novel, here are five ways you can do the work towards your own awakening and resolving trauma." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Using vulnerability to bring a sense of belonging" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Most of us would probably agree that to be wholly accepted would be a desirable state of being. On the importance of belonging, Rachel says “inclusion highlights our dissonance and asks us all to get along. We can be included and still feel different, separate and alone. Belonging, on the other hand, welcomes authenticity, individuality and our differences with other people are not experienced as dissonance. We resonate within our diversity.” She adds: “when we belong, we begin to heal. Because it is safe to be vulnerable—to express and to share.” When we can convey who we are truly in a secure space, we start to choose ourselves and restore ourselves. On the flip side of this, of un-belonging comes shame, a response that can be paralysing, laced with fear while sparking a deep concern on how we are being perceived. Being able to wholly express ourselves veritably allows us to de-armour, “expression ignites a natural transformation inside us and through it, we ensure we are no longer suppressing our truth.”" +

With the global skincare market expected to reach sales of over $207 billion by 2028, you can bet there are bigger and better treatments, products, tools and innovation to come in this sector. Whether it’s how to look more naturally “snatched” or a more savvy and cost effective approach to a good skincare routine, below Vogue speaks to the experts to find out the biggest skincare trends for 2023." +

      "A new wave of treatments promise to deliver the snatched skin that dreams were made of. EmFace combines radio-frequency with high intensity electric fields to boost collagen and elastin, firm the skin and ultimately boost the face’s underlying muscle structure for a more sculpted appearance. Needle-free and with no downtime, it’s the key to warding off sagging." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Meanwhile, in-demand aesthetic doctor Dr Sophie Shotter will launch her Advanced Collagen Remodelling Tweakment, a series of treatments that begins with the use of Allergan’s new hybrid injectable, HArmonyCa, to restore facial volume while promoting the natural production of skin collagen. The second, performed a month later, uses Volite, an injectable hyaluronic acid, to boost hydration and texture. You’ll also be sent home with an ingestible collagen supplement and retinoid cream to boost collagen from the inside-out." +

      "There is no such thing as optimal skin health without a balanced lifestyle—deep down, we all know that. But according to The Future Laboratory, we’re increasingly opting to incorporate “science-led beauty formulas and tools that are designed to have direct health benefits”. Whether it’s Iräye’s lymphatic skincare, that topically activates the body’s lymphatic system, or the TheraFace Pro device which harnesses the powers of percussive therapy to reduce stress-induced facial tension and ease migraines (as well as cleanse the skin), the products we’ll be lusting after go much deeper than simply skin health—they’re also excellent for our overall wellbeing." +

Andrea Pfeffer, who founded London’s ultra popular Pfeffer Sal clinic, has just launched her new venture, Salon C. Stellar. Yes, your skin will glow, but so will your soul, thanks to its offering of breath work, astrology, and nutritional therapy, alongside pack-a-punch facials: “Treatments need to be more than just one dimensional,” she says. “You need to walk out of the salon, having had a transformative experience that has multiple benefits, such as stress release or spiritual reassurance, in addition to achieving great skin.”" +

It’s a hot topic these days, but relying on manifestation can actually make you incredibly passive in your life and keep you in a place that is not empowered by the change that you lead, are in charge of and own.

      "In the fitness world, recovery hacks are all the rage. Whether ice baths, visits to Stretch Lab, cryo chambers or saunas, we make it our mission to help our bodies recover physically after challenging sessions. However, “we rarely apply the same mindset to other types of life event that deserve just as much focus on recovery,” says Rhian Stephenson, nutritionist, naturopath and founder of Artah. “Taking a proactive approach to recover from immense stress, physical injury, emotional events and illnesses is an essential aspect of cultivating resilience. We’re naturally impatient, so often try to get right back to normal after an injury, Covid infection or having a baby, but skipping the recovery phase creates a false sense of progress.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "She advises adopting a mindset that values recovery as one of the core pillars of health (alongside exercise and nutrition) to focus on. It can be as simple as taking probiotics (we love Artah’s new Enhanced Probiotic) after antibiotic use or as big as investing in therapy after an emotional event. “The key is acknowledging that investment in recovery is an investment in both our current and future wellbeing.”" +

      "“To start on the path of loving oneself I recommend learning to ‘listen’,” explains Dr Marianetti who has a doctorate in human psychology from the Institute of Advanced Studies of Human Sexuality and a MSc in occupational and organisational psychology from the University of East London. “Our mind, our body and our heart are constantly sending signals to our awareness, pointing the way to something that needs to be attended to.

      "“If I were born a peach tree, I would have the innate capacity to produce juicy, sweet peaches that anyone could enjoy. However, if I spent my life trying to be a pear tree, because the world told me that the only way to be loved, accepted and successful was to produce pears, I would likely negate my innate nature or perhaps even despise it for not equipping me with the ability to produce pears and therefore be unsuccessful.”" +

      "Body positivity, body neutrality and inclusivity are the name of the game for women’s fashion and beauty brands. But where have men been in the conversation about body image issues? Turns out, many of them can be found at a gym, quietly whipping their bodies into shape. The topic of body image issues in men, whether it’s body dysmorphic disorders like bigorexia or eating disorders like anorexia and bulimia, have long plagued males from as young as 11 years old to those well over their 40s. Notorious for internalising their issues, men prefer to remain stoic in the face of complicated feelings surrounding their body image. However, celebrities like Zac Efron, Sam Smith and Robert Pattinson have started to share their struggles with body image. Channing Tatum, who said that he had to starve himself to achieve his lean physique for the upcoming Magic Mike 3, has also publicly stated that it’s not healthy to be that ripped. You may say that achieving perceived physical perfection is just part of being a celebrity. But even everyday men are pushing themselves beyond their limits due to the rise of fitness accounts on social media that have set the standards for what’s considered physically ‘normal’ today." +

It’s little wonder then that both adolescent boys and adult men are chasing the ‘Dorito bod’, a term that describes a male body shape characterised by broad shoulders and a small waist that is popularised by bodybuilders. Many enjoy the validation they get through the number of likes they receive on social media, making this ‘struggle’ seem like it’s worth it. But not many have spoken up about why they were motivated to achieve this in the first place. Is it admiration or insecurity?" +

Tan, who has an interest in body dysmorphia and eating disorders, reveals that physical issues that contribute to poor self-esteem among men typically involve muscularity and adiposity. “Common triggers include cultural and societal expectations, social media use, social comparisons, perfectionistic tendencies and negative life experiences such as teasing and bullying.”" +

      "Dominic Chin is no stranger to feeling disillusioned with his body. “I noticed that I was gaining a lot of weight whenI was about 14. I jumped from 61kg to almost 110kg when I was about 21 years old,” the 27-year-old singer-songwriter reveals. He developed a deep sense of self-hatred, and also felt depressed and anxious. Despite this, Chin chose the route of being a performer simply because he enjoyed singing. He hoped to find solace in pursuing his passion, but was quickly proven wrong." +

      "<br />" +
      "“I thought that only your talent mattered if you wanted to be in the industry. After being in it, I realised that you can’t escape the topic of one’s appearance, whether it’s your own or someone else’s,” Chin admits. “Every detail, from the texture of your skin to how your clothes fit, is pointed out. So, imagine the stress and anxiety I had to endure being hyper aware of every detail, including my weight.”" +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "Chin was prescribed appetite suppressants and he also started working out at a gym to lose weight. Then he developed an unhealthy relationship with food, which he considers his only source of comfort. “I found myself questioning my self-worth every time I ate because I was so afraid of gaining all the weight back,” he recalls. He made the decision to seek psychological help and is happy to report that he is doing well. “It’s not easy to erase all that trauma. But learning how to love myself has taught me to cope whenever I experience intrusive thoughts.”" +

      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "She adds that there’s been a big shift towards low impact exercises. “People have discovered that you can have the best body of your life without feeling like you’re killing yourself. Pilates offers focused workouts that are as effective as they are fun, and people are realizing that working out doesn’t have to be something that’s painful.”" +

      "“There are many benefits to doing Pilates on a Reformer,” Andersen says. “The straps and springs offer both resistance and assistance, depending on the workout, and the ability to move the carriage around allows you to do eccentric exercises. The targeted workouts you receive from a Pilates reformer improve coordination, flexibility, and mobility." +

      "By 2025, over a billion women globally will be post-menopausal, according to the North American Menopause Society. Yet despite its universality, Dr Sylvia Ramirez of Cutis Medical Laser Clinics believes the attitudes towards menopause have remained largely unchanged: that is to say, negative, with menopausal women still being dismissed as “irritable, emotional and erratic”. Little has been done to rebrand menopause after 19th-century physicians identified hysterical fits as one of 50 symptoms, perpetuating a culture of silence around one of the last taboos, says Ramirez. After all, which strong, empowered woman wants to be dismissed or stereotyped as being excessively moody and wildly hormonal? " +

They don’t want to turn back the clock to a younger version of themselves; they want to relish the moment they are living in now, and the trials and triumphs that got them there.”" +

      "Dr Susan Logan, senior consultant, Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology at National University Hospital tells Vogue Singapore, “Menopause comes from the Greek word ‘mensis’ or month and pausis, cessation.” Menopause, shares Dr Logan, is when a woman’s menses stops for 12 months due to “ovaries running out of eggs like a gasoline tank in a car.” Women are born with all the eggs they will ever have, somewhere between 700,000–1 million eggs. When these get to low numbers, the menopause occurs. The date is the date of a woman’s last menses." +
      "<br />" +
      "<br />" +
      "A 2005 study in Singapore revealed the top common symptoms of menopause as being muscle and joint aches and pains, lethargy, headaches, insomnia, irritability, poor concentration, a dry or sore vagina, dizziness, urinary bladder symptoms, a loss of sex, depression and finally hot flashes. A similar research programme conducted by the Integrated Women’s Health Programme at the National University Hospital in 2017 found the proportion of women affected by each symptom to be even higher.
